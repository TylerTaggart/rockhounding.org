            <h2>Rock Pick and Geological Hammer FAQ</h2>
    
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the difference between a rock pick and a geological hammer?</h3>
                <p>While both are used for rockhounding, there are key differences:<br>
                Rock picks typically have a pointed tip on one end and a chisel edge on the other, making them versatile for breaking and prying rocks.<br>
                Geological hammers often have a flat face instead of a chisel edge, better suited for striking chisels or breaking larger rocks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What weight of rock pick is best for me?</h3>
                <p>The ideal weight depends on your strength and the type of rock you'll be working with.<br>
                Beginners or those with less arm strength might prefer lighter picks (10-16 ounces).<br>
                For harder rocks or more experienced users, heavier picks (20-24 ounces) can provide more power.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are the different grip options for rock picks, and which is best?</h3>
                <p>Common grip options include:<br>
                Rubber grips: Offer good shock absorption and comfort.<br>
                Vinyl grips: Durable and provide a good grip even when wet.<br>
                Leather grips: Traditional and comfortable, but may require more maintenance.<br>
                The best grip depends on personal preference and the climate you'll be working in.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need a rock pick with a shock reduction grip?</h3>
                <p>Shock reduction grips are designed to minimize vibration and impact, reducing hand fatigue during prolonged use.<br>
                If you plan on doing a lot of rockhounding, a shock reduction grip can be a valuable feature.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I care for my rock pick?</h3>
                <p>Keep the pick clean and dry, especially the metal parts, to prevent rust.<br>
                Sharpen the pointed tip and chisel edge as needed.<br>
                If your pick has a leather grip, condition it occasionally to prevent drying and cracking.<br>
                Store the pick in a dry place when not in use.</p>
