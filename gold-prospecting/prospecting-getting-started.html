            <h3>What is Gold Prospecting?</h3>
            <p>Gold prospecting involves searching for gold deposits in their natural environment. It's an exciting way to explore the outdoors, learn about geology, and potentially discover valuable gold specimens. Think of it as a treasure hunt where the Earth is your map!</p>

            <h3>Why Prospect for Gold?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adventure:</strong> Explore new places, uncover hidden gold, and experience the thrill of unearthing nature's treasures.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Discover the fascinating world of geology, Earth's history, and the unique properties of gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Profit:</strong> Some finds can be valuable and can be sold or kept as investment pieces, adding an extra layer of excitement to your adventures.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun for All Ages:</strong> Gold prospecting is a rewarding outdoor activity the whole family can enjoy. It reduces stress, gets you moving, and connects you with nature.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Gold Prospecting</h3>
            <p>Gold prospecting encompasses a variety of methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Placer Mining:</strong> Searching for gold in riverbeds and streambeds where it has settled over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Lode Mining:</strong> Extracting gold from veins of rock in the earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Metal Detecting:</strong> Using metal detectors to find buried gold nuggets and other metals.</li>
                <li><strong>Sluicing:</strong> Using a sluice box to process larger amounts of material and extract gold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where to Look for Gold</h2>
            <p>The thrill of gold prospecting lies in the search! Here are some common places to explore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Lands:</strong> National forests, BLM land, and some state parks allow gold prospecting. Be sure to check specific regulations for each area.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Claims:</strong> Some prospectors stake claims on private land where they have exclusive rights to collect. These are often advertised or shared within prospecting communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Mines and Quarries:</strong> Old mines and quarries can be treasure troves, but always prioritize safety and obtain permission if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay-to-Dig Sites:</strong> These privately owned sites offer a guaranteed opportunity to find gold for a fee.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction Sites:</strong> New construction can unearth hidden gold, but always ask for permission before entering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="ethics">Gold Prospecting Ethics</h2>
            <p>As prospectors, we respect the environment and the rights of others:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Pack out everything you pack in, and leave the land as you found it.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Private Property:</strong> Always obtain permission before prospecting on private land.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Regulations:</strong> Check for any local permits or restrictions before heading out.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>If you are serious about rockhounding, it is hard to go without a shovel. Really any shovel will do, hopefully you already have one. But if you don't this is a nice well rated shovel on Amazon. Shovels are also used a lot in gold recovery to shovel dirt or mud into a sluice.</p>

                    <h3>Hammer Pick</h3>
                    <p>This is an absolute must have for rockhounding. It is great for digging into tough dirt to remove a specimin, or to carefully break a rock apart to see the inside. We never leave the house to go rockhounding without one.</p>

                    <h3>Standard Pick Axe</h3>
                    <p>While not a beginners item, having a sturdy pick axe is quite useful as you get into the trenches (pun intended) of rockhounding. These are great for digging a bit faster when you don't need to be as careful to not break a specimin.</p>

                    <h3>Metal Detector + Accesesories</h3>
                    <p>Metal detecting is a great way to find gold, silver, and other precious and semi-precious metals. This is great for urban metal recovery or heading out to the desert to look for gold nuggets and old coins. We don't have it listed in essentials because it is a bit pricey for just starting out.</p>

            <button class="accordion">1. Do I need any special skills to start gold prospecting?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Not at all! Gold prospecting is a hobby that anyone can enjoy. While some knowledge of geology is helpful, it's not necessary to get started. The most important things are curiosity, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">2. Do I need any special equipment to start gold prospecting?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>While you can start with just a few basic tools like a gold pan, safety glasses, and gloves, having a few more specialized tools (like sluice boxes, metal detectors, and classifiers) can make your experience more enjoyable and fruitful. Check out our "Essential Tools" section above for recommendations!</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">3. Where can I go gold prospecting?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Gold prospecting locations vary widely, but you can often find great spots on public lands like national forests and BLM areas. Private claims, old mines, quarries, and pay-to-dig sites are also options. Always research the specific regulations for the location you choose and obtain permission if necessary. Find the best places to prospect for gold across different states in the US here.</p>

            <button class="accordion">4. Is gold prospecting legal?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Gold prospecting is legal in many places, but regulations vary. Always research the specific rules for the area you plan to visit. Some areas may require permits or restrict the types or amounts of material you can collect.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">5. Do I need permission to prospect for gold?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Permission is always required for prospecting on private property. Public lands often have specific regulations, so check with the managing agency before you go. Some areas may require permits or have restrictions on what you can collect.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">6. How do I identify the gold I find?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Gold is typically yellow and dense. It can be distinguished from other minerals by its color, heft, and malleability (it won't shatter when struck). You can also use a gold test kit or have it assayed for precise identification.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">7. Is gold prospecting safe?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Gold prospecting can be safe and enjoyable with proper precautions. Always wear appropriate clothing and footwear, bring a first aid kit and plenty of water, and be aware of your surroundings. Avoid unstable terrain, be mindful of wildlife, and never go prospecting alone.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">8. Can I sell the gold I find?</button>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>If you find a gold nugget on public land, it's generally considered public property and must be left in place. However, you can often take pictures or make notes of your discovery. If you find a gold nugget on private land, always obtain permission from the landowner before removing it.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">10. How can I learn more about gold prospecting?</button>
