            <h1>Essential Tools and Equipment</h1>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Precious metal prospecting tools (1).jpg" alt="Prospecting Tools">
            </div>
            <p>Equipping yourself with the right tools is crucial for a successful and enjoyable precious metal prospecting experience. The specific gear you'll need may vary depending on the type of prospecting you pursue and the terrain you'll be exploring. However, certain essential tools are common across various prospecting methods:</p>

            <h2>1. Gold Pan</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/goldPan.png" alt="Gold Pan">
            </div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A gold pan is a shallow, wide-rimmed pan used to separate gold from sand and gravel. It's a fundamental tool for placer gold prospecting, where gold has been deposited in riverbeds or alluvial deposits.</p>
            <p><strong>Material:</strong> Typically made of steel or plastic, with riffles (ridges) on the bottom to trap heavy materials like gold.</p>
            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Panning involves swirling water and sediment in the pan, allowing lighter materials to wash away while denser gold particles settle at the bottom.</p>

            <h2>2. Sluice Box</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Sluice Box.jpg" alt="Sluice Box">
            </div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A sluice box is a trough-like device used to process larger amounts of material than a gold pan. It uses water flow and riffles to trap gold and other heavy minerals.</p>
            <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Typically made of metal or plastic, with a series of riffles and mats designed to capture gold.</p>
            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> A sluice box is placed in a stream or river, with water flowing through it. Material is fed into the top, and gold is trapped by the riffles and mats.</p>

            <h2>3. Metal Detector</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Metal Detector.jpg" alt="Metal Detector">
            </div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Metal detectors use electromagnetic fields to detect metal objects buried underground, including gold nuggets. They are invaluable for finding gold in areas where it's not easily visible.</p>
            <p><strong>Types:</strong> Metal detectors come in various types, including Very Low Frequency (VLF), Pulse Induction (PI), and Multi-Frequency detectors. Each has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the ground conditions and target size.</p>
            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Sweeping the detector coil over the ground while listening for signals indicating the presence of metal.</p>

            <h2>4. Digging Tools</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Digging Tools.jpg" alt="Digging Tools">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shovel:</strong> A sturdy shovel is essential for excavating soil and gravel to access potential gold-bearing layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Pickaxe:</strong> This tool is useful for breaking up hard-packed ground or rocks to uncover hidden deposits.</li>
                <li><strong>Hand Trowel:</strong> A smaller trowel is handy for fine-tuning excavations and removing delicate specimens.</li>
                <li><strong>Probe:</strong> A long, thin probe can help locate buried objects detected by a metal detector.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Classifier</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Classifier.jpg" alt="Classifier">
            </div>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> A classifier is a screen with various mesh sizes used to separate different sizes of materials. It helps remove larger rocks and debris, making it easier to find smaller gold particles.</p>
            <p><strong>Types:</strong> Classifiers come in various sizes and mesh configurations, depending on the desired material separation.</p>
            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Material is poured onto the classifier, and smaller particles pass through while larger ones are retained.</p>

            <h2>6. Safety Gear</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/Safety gear.jpg" alt="Safety Gear">
