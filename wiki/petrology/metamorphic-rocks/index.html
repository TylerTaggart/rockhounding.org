      <h1>Metamorphic Rocks</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
        <p>Metamorphic rocks are formed through the transformation of existing rocks under the influence of high pressure, high temperature, and chemically active fluids. This process, known as metamorphism, alters the mineral composition, texture, and sometimes the chemical composition of the original rock, resulting in new and distinct types of rocks.</p>
        <p>Metamorphic rocks are classified into two main types: foliated and non-foliated. Foliated metamorphic rocks, such as schist and gneiss, have a layered or banded appearance, while non-foliated rocks, like marble and quartzite, do not exhibit layering. The formation of these rocks provides valuable insights into the geological processes that occur deep within the Earth's crust.</p>
        <p>This page explores the formation, classification, and types of metamorphic rocks, providing detailed information on their characteristics and how they are studied in petrology.</p>
      </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/metamorphic-rocks/foliated.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="foliated-rocks" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
          <p>Foliated metamorphic rocks are characterized by their layered or banded appearance, which results from the alignment of mineral grains under directed pressure. Common examples include schist, gneiss, and slate. These rocks are often associated with regional metamorphism, where large-scale tectonic forces produce significant deformation and recrystallization of minerals.</p>
          <p>The study of foliated rocks can reveal important information about the conditions of metamorphism, including the direction and intensity of pressure and the temperature at which the rock formed.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn more about the formation, characteristics, and types of foliated metamorphic rocks.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/metamorphic-rocks/non-foliated.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="non-foliated-rocks" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Non-foliated Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
          <p>Non-foliated metamorphic rocks do not exhibit a layered or banded appearance. Instead, they have a more uniform texture, which is typically a result of contact metamorphism, where heat from a nearby magma body causes recrystallization of the minerals. Common examples include marble, formed from limestone, and quartzite, formed from quartz sandstone.</p>
          <p>Non-foliated rocks provide insights into the effects of temperature and fluid activity during metamorphism, often revealing the history of contact between different rock types.</p>
          <p>Learn about the formation, characteristics, and examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks in this section.</p>

        <section id="mineral-composition" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Mineral Composition of Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
          <p>The mineral composition of metamorphic rocks is determined by the original rock's composition and the conditions of metamorphism. Common metamorphic minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, and garnet, each of which can provide clues about the pressure, temperature, and chemical environment during the rock's formation.</p>
          <p>Understanding the mineral composition of metamorphic rocks is essential for interpreting their history and the processes that led to their formation.</p>
          <p>This section delves into the mineral composition of metamorphic rocks, explaining how different minerals form and what they reveal about metamorphic conditions.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/metamorphic-rocks/classification.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="classification" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Classification of Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
          <p>Metamorphic rocks are classified based on their texture (foliated or non-foliated) and mineral composition. This classification system helps geologists understand the processes that led to the rock's formation and its place within the broader context of Earth's geology.</p>
          <p>The classification of metamorphic rocks is a key part of petrology, allowing for the identification and study of these rocks in both field and laboratory settings.</p>
          <p>In this section, you'll learn about the classification of metamorphic rocks, the criteria used, and how this knowledge is applied in geological studies.</p>
