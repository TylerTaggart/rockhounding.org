      <h1>Rock Cycling</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to the Rock Cycle</h2>
        <p>The rock cycle is a continuous and dynamic process that describes the transformation of rocks through various geological processes over time. It explains how igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks are formed, broken down, and reformed through processes such as melting, cooling, erosion, deposition, compaction, and metamorphism.</p>
        <p>This cycle plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface and is fundamental to understanding the geological history of our planet. By studying the rock cycle, geologists can gain insights into past environmental conditions, tectonic activity, and the processes that have shaped the landscape over millions of years.</p>
        <p>This page explores the different stages of the rock cycle, the processes involved, and how rocks transition from one type to another. It provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and the significance of the rock cycle in petrology.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/rock-cycling/igneous-formation.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="igneous-formation" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Formation of Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava. This process can occur beneath the Earth's surface, resulting in intrusive igneous rocks, or at the surface, leading to the formation of extrusive igneous rocks. The cooling rate and composition of the magma play a significant role in determining the texture and mineral composition of the resulting rock.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn about the different types of igneous rocks, the processes that lead to their formation, and their importance in the rock cycle.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/rock-cycling/sedimentary-formation.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="sedimentary-formation" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Formation of Sedimentary Rocks</h2>
          <p>Sedimentary rocks are formed through the deposition, compaction, and cementation of sediments, which can include fragments of other rocks, minerals, and organic material. These rocks often form in layers, or strata, and are commonly found in environments such as rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
          <p>Learn about the processes that lead to the formation of sedimentary rocks, the different types of sedimentary rocks, and their role in preserving Earth's history.</p>
        </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/rock-cycling/metamorphic-formation.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="metamorphic-formation" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Formation of Metamorphic Rocks</h2>
          <p>Metamorphic rocks are formed from the transformation of existing rocks under the influence of high pressure, high temperature, or chemically active fluids. This process, known as metamorphism, alters the mineral composition and structure of the rock without melting it.</p>
          <p>In this section, you'll discover the different types of metamorphic rocks, the conditions that lead to their formation, and their significance in the rock cycle.</p>
        </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/rock-cycling/erosion-and-weathering.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="erosion-weathering" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Erosion and Weathering</h2>
          <p>Erosion and weathering are the processes that break down rocks into smaller particles, which are then transported by wind, water, or ice. Weathering can be physical, chemical, or biological, and it plays a crucial role in the formation of sedimentary rocks by producing the sediments that accumulate and eventually lithify.</p>
          <p>Explore the different types of weathering and erosion, their impact on the landscape, and how they contribute to the rock cycle in this section.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/rock-cycling/melting-and-recycling.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="melting-recycling" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Melting and Recycling</h2>
          <p>Melting occurs when rocks are subjected to high temperatures, typically within the Earth's mantle, leading to the formation of magma. This magma can then cool and solidify to form new igneous rocks, completing the rock cycle. Recycling of rocks is a natural part of the cycle, where rocks are continually broken down and reformed over geological time.</p>
          <p>In this section, you will learn about the melting process, the recycling of rocks, and the continuous nature of the rock cycle.</p>
