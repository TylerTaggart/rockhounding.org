      <h1>Igneous Rocks</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Igneous Rocks</h2>
        <p>Igneous rocks are one of the three main types of rocks, formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. These rocks are characterized by their mineral composition and texture, which can vary widely depending on the environment in which they form.</p>
        <p>Igneous rocks are broadly classified into two categories: intrusive (plutonic) rocks, which form below the Earth's surface, and extrusive (volcanic) rocks, which form on the surface. Common examples include granite (intrusive) and basalt (extrusive). These rocks are important in understanding the Earth's geology and the processes that shape our planet.</p>
        <p>This page explores the formation, classification, and types of igneous rocks, providing detailed information on their characteristics and how they are studied in petrology.</p>
      </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/igneous-rocks/intrusive.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="intrusive-rocks" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Intrusive Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>Intrusive igneous rocks, also known as plutonic rocks, form when magma cools and solidifies beneath the Earth's surface. Because they cool slowly, these rocks typically have large, well-formed crystals. Granite, diorite, and gabbro are common examples of intrusive igneous rocks.</p>
          <p>Intrusive rocks are often exposed at the surface through processes such as uplift and erosion. They provide valuable information about the Earth's interior and are widely used in construction and decoration due to their durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn more about the formation, characteristics, and types of intrusive igneous rocks.</p>

        <section id="extrusive-rocks" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Extrusive Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>Extrusive igneous rocks, or volcanic rocks, form when lava cools and solidifies on the Earth's surface. Because they cool quickly, these rocks often have small crystals or a glassy texture. Basalt, andesite, and obsidian are common examples of extrusive igneous rocks.</p>
          <p>Extrusive rocks are often associated with volcanic activity and can provide insights into the Earth's surface processes and the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. These rocks are also important in the formation of new landmasses and contribute to soil fertility in volcanic regions.</p>
          <p>This section delves into the formation, characteristics, and types of extrusive igneous rocks, offering a comprehensive overview of these fascinating materials.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/igneous-rocks/texture.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="igneous-rock-texture" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Texture of Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>The texture of an igneous rock refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of its mineral grains or crystals. The texture is determined by the rate of cooling and the environment in which the rock forms. Common textures include phaneritic (coarse-grained), aphanitic (fine-grained), porphyritic, and glassy.</p>
          <p>The study of rock textures is crucial for understanding the history of igneous rocks and their formation processes. The texture can reveal important information about the conditions under which the rock formed, such as the cooling rate and the presence of volatiles.</p>
          <p>Learn more about the different textures of igneous rocks and how they are used to interpret geological history in this section.</p>

        <section id="mineral-composition" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Mineral Composition of Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>The mineral composition of an igneous rock is determined by the chemical composition of the magma or lava from which it forms. Common minerals found in igneous rocks include quartz, feldspar, mica, and olivine. The specific minerals present in a rock can help identify its type and origin.</p>
          <p>Igneous rocks are often classified based on their mineral composition, which reflects the conditions of their formation. For example, rocks with a high silica content, such as granite, are classified as felsic, while those with a lower silica content, like basalt, are classified as mafic.</p>
          <p>This section explores the mineral composition of igneous rocks and how it relates to their classification and geological significance.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/petrology/igneous-rocks/classification.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="classification" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Classification of Igneous Rocks</h2>
          <p>Igneous rocks are classified based on their texture and mineral composition. This classification helps geologists understand the rock's formation history and its place within the broader context of Earth's geology. The main categories include felsic, intermediate, mafic, and ultramafic rocks.</p>
          <p>The classification of igneous rocks is essential for identifying and studying them in the field and laboratory. Understanding the classification system allows for a deeper appreciation of the diversity and complexity of igneous rocks.</p>
          <p>In this section, you'll learn about the classification of igneous rocks, the criteria used, and how to apply this knowledge to rock identification and analysis.</p>
