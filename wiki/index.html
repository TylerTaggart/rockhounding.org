            <section id="mineralogy" class="wiki-section">
              <h2>Mineralogy</h2>
              <p>Mineralogy is a branch of geology that focuses on the study of minerals—the building blocks of rocks. This section invites you to explore the diverse world of minerals, their chemical compositions, and their crystalline structures, which determine their physical properties such as hardness, color, and luster. Learn how minerals are classified into groups such as silicates, oxides, and carbonates, and discover the processes through which these minerals form, both in nature and through geological time. Whether you're identifying minerals in the field or studying them under a microscope, this section will deepen your understanding of the mineral kingdom.</p>

            <section id="petrology" class="wiki-section">
              <h2>Petrology</h2>
              <p>Petrology is the scientific study of rocks, which are aggregates of minerals and are the fundamental units that make up the Earth's crust. This section provides a thorough exploration of the three main rock types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Delve into the origins of these rocks, from the molten magma that cools to form igneous rocks, to the sediment deposition that creates sedimentary layers, and the intense heat and pressure that transform rocks into metamorphic forms. Understanding petrology is crucial for deciphering the history of our planet, as rocks are the records of Earth's past environments and geological events.</p>
