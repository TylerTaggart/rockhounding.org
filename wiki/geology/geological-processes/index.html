      <h1>Geological Processes</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Geological Processes</h2>
        <p>Geological processes are the dynamic forces that shape the Earth's surface and interior over time. These processes are responsible for the formation of mountains, valleys, volcanoes, and the rock cycle that continuously recycles the Earth's crust. Understanding geological processes is essential for comprehending the history and structure of our planet.</p>
        <p>From the slow movement of tectonic plates to the rapid eruption of volcanoes, geological processes operate on timescales ranging from seconds to millions of years. These processes are driven by the Earth's internal heat and the energy from the sun, which together influence the formation, alteration, and destruction of rocks and landscapes.</p>
        <p>This page explores the key geological processes that shape our planet, including plate tectonics, volcanism, erosion, weathering, and sedimentation. Each section provides an in-depth look at these processes, their effects, and their significance in the study of geology.</p>
      </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/geological-processes/plate-tectonics.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="plate-tectonics" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Plate Tectonics</h2>
          <p>Plate tectonics is the theory that explains the movement of the Earth's lithospheric plates. These plates, which make up the Earth's crust and upper mantle, float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. The interactions between these plates, such as collision, separation, and sliding past one another, create various geological features like mountains, earthquakes, and ocean basins.</p>
          <p>The concept of plate tectonics revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's geology, providing a unifying framework for explaining the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges. It also plays a crucial role in the rock cycle, as the movement of plates leads to the formation and destruction of rocks over geological time.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn about the different types of plate boundaries, the mechanisms driving plate movement, and the geological features and phenomena associated with plate tectonics.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/geological-processes/volcanism.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="volcanism" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Volcanism</h2>
          <p>Volcanism refers to the process by which magma (molten rock) from the Earth's interior is expelled to the surface, forming volcanoes, lava flows, and other volcanic features. This process plays a significant role in the formation of the Earth's crust and the release of gases that contribute to the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>Volcanism can occur at various tectonic settings, such as divergent boundaries, convergent boundaries, and hotspots. The type of volcanic activity, including explosive eruptions and effusive lava flows, depends on factors such as the composition of the magma and the tectonic environment.</p>
          <p>In this section, delve into the different types of volcanic activity, the structures formed by volcanic processes, and the impact of volcanism on the Earth's geology and environment.</p>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/geological-processes/erosion-and-weathering.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="erosion-and-weathering" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Erosion and Weathering</h2>
          <p>Erosion and weathering are processes that break down rocks and minerals at the Earth's surface. Weathering involves the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks into smaller particles, while erosion is the transportation of these particles by wind, water, ice, or gravity.</p>
          <p>These processes are crucial in shaping landscapes, creating soil, and influencing the rock cycle. Erosion and weathering also contribute to the formation of sedimentary rocks, as the broken-down material is eventually deposited and compacted into new rock layers.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn about the different types of weathering (physical, chemical, and biological), the agents of erosion, and the role of these processes in shaping the Earth's surface.</p>
        </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/geological-processes/sedimentation.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="sedimentation" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Sedimentation</h2>
          <p>Sedimentation is the process by which sediment is deposited in layers, forming sedimentary rocks over time. This process occurs when particles carried by wind, water, or ice are laid down in a new location, typically in basins such as lakes, rivers, and oceans.</p>
          <p>Sedimentary rocks are unique in that they often contain fossils and other evidence of past environments, making them valuable for understanding Earth's history. The study of sedimentation helps geologists reconstruct ancient landscapes, climate conditions, and the processes that have shaped the Earth's surface.</p>
          <p>In this section, explore the processes of sediment transport, deposition, and lithification, as well as the different environments where sedimentation occurs and the types of sedimentary rocks that form.</p>
