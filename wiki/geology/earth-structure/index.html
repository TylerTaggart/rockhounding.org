      <h1>Earth Structure</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Earth's Structure</h2>
        <p>The structure of the Earth is a complex system composed of several distinct layers, each with its own properties and significance. Understanding the Earth's structure is fundamental to the study of geology, as it helps explain the dynamic processes that shape our planet, including tectonics, volcanism, and the formation of mountains.</p>
        <p>The Earth is generally divided into three main layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core. Each of these layers plays a crucial role in the Earth's overall structure and function, from the solid surface we live on to the molten core that drives plate tectonics and generates the planet's magnetic field.</p>
        <p>This page provides an in-depth exploration of the Earth's structure, covering the characteristics and significance of each layer. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced geologist, this guide will deepen your understanding of the Earth's inner workings.</p>
      </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/earth-structure/crust.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="crust" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>The Crust</h2>
          <p>The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, where we live and where all surface geological processes occur. It is a thin, solid layer made up of a variety of rocks and minerals, ranging from the oceanic crust, which is primarily composed of basalt, to the continental crust, which is made up of granite and other less dense rocks.</p>
          <p>The crust is divided into tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid upper mantle. The interactions between these plates cause earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation of mountains. Understanding the crust's composition and behavior is essential for studying Earth's geology and predicting geological events.</p>
          <p>In this section, explore the composition, types, and dynamics of Earth's crust, including the processes that shape its structure and influence its behavior over geological time.</p>
        </section>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/earth-structure/mantle.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="mantle" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>The Mantle</h2>
          <p>The mantle is the thick, semi-solid layer that lies beneath the Earth's crust, extending to a depth of about 2,900 kilometers. It is composed mainly of silicate minerals rich in iron and magnesium, and it is the source of magma that erupts from volcanoes.</p>
          <p>The mantle is not completely solid; it behaves plastically and can flow slowly over long periods, driving the movement of tectonic plates. This flow is responsible for the convection currents that help transfer heat from the Earth's interior to the surface.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn about the structure, composition, and dynamics of the Earth's mantle, including its role in plate tectonics and the geothermal processes that shape the Earth's surface.</p>
        </section>
      </a>

      <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/wiki/geology/earth-structure/core.html" class="wiki-link">
        <section id="core" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>The Core</h2>
          <p>The Earth's core is the innermost layer, composed primarily of iron and nickel. It is divided into two parts: the solid inner core and the liquid outer core. The inner core, despite being hotter than the outer core, remains solid due to the immense pressure at the Earth's center.</p>
          <p>The outer core is liquid and is responsible for generating the Earth's magnetic field through the process of convection. The movement of molten iron within the outer core creates electric currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field that protects the Earth from solar radiation.</p>
          <p>In this section, discover the characteristics of the Earth's core, the processes that occur within it, and its significance in the Earth's magnetic and geothermal systems.</p>
