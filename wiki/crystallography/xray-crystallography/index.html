      <h1>X-ray Crystallography</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to X-ray Crystallography</h2>
        <p>X-ray crystallography is a powerful and widely used technique in crystallography that allows scientists to determine the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal. By analyzing the way X-rays are diffracted as they pass through a crystal, researchers can map out the arrangement of atoms within the crystal, revealing its structure in precise detail.</p>
        <p>This technique has been instrumental in the discovery of the structures of many important biological molecules, including DNA, proteins, and enzymes, as well as in the study of minerals and synthetic materials. X-ray crystallography is a cornerstone of materials science, chemistry, and molecular biology, providing critical insights into the properties and behavior of crystals.</p>
        <p>This page introduces the principles of X-ray crystallography, explores the techniques used, and highlights its applications in various scientific fields.</p>

        <section id="principles" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Principles of X-ray Crystallography</h2>
          <p>The principles of X-ray crystallography are based on the diffraction of X-rays by the regular, repeating patterns of atoms in a crystal. When X-rays are directed at a crystal, they are scattered by the electrons in the atoms, creating a diffraction pattern that can be recorded and analyzed to determine the crystal's structure.</p>
          <p>The key to this technique is Bragg's Law, which relates the angles at which X-rays are diffracted to the distances between planes of atoms in the crystal. By applying Bragg's Law, scientists can calculate the positions of atoms and build a detailed model of the crystal's atomic structure.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn more about the fundamental principles of X-ray crystallography, including how X-ray diffraction works and the mathematical techniques used to interpret diffraction patterns.</p>

          <h2>X-ray Crystallography Techniques</h2>
          <p>X-ray crystallography involves several techniques, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, and electron density mapping. Each of these techniques has its own applications and is suited to different types of samples and research questions.</p>
          <p>Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is used to determine the structure of individual crystals, providing detailed information about the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. Powder X-ray diffraction is used when the sample consists of many small crystals or when a single-crystal is not available, and it provides information about the overall structure of the material.</p>
          <p>This section explores the various techniques used in X-ray crystallography, the equipment required, and the steps involved in preparing and analyzing samples.</p>

        <section id="applications" class="wiki-section">
          <h2>Applications of X-ray Crystallography</h2>
          <p>X-ray crystallography has a wide range of applications in science and industry. In biology, it is used to determine the structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules, providing insights into their function and interactions. In chemistry, it is used to analyze the structures of small molecules and complex compounds, aiding in the design of new materials and drugs.</p>
          <p>In geology and materials science, X-ray crystallography is used to study minerals and synthetic materials, helping to understand their properties and behaviors. The technique is also used in quality control and manufacturing, where it is essential for verifying the structure and purity of materials.</p>
          <p>Explore this section to learn about the diverse applications of X-ray crystallography and how it has advanced our understanding of the natural world and contributed to technological innovations.</p>
