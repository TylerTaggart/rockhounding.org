        <h1>Pyrite: The Fool's Gold</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Pyrite</h2>
          <p>Pyrite, often known as "fool's gold," is an iron sulfide mineral (FeS<sub>2</sub>) with a metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue. It is one of the most common sulfide minerals and is often mistaken for gold due to its color and sheen. Despite this, pyrite is an important industrial mineral, especially in the production of sulfuric acid.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, pyrite is a popular mineral to collect due to its crystal forms, which can range from cubes to octahedrons and other complex shapes. It is often found in association with other minerals such as quartz and galena.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Pyrite Forms</h2>
          <p>Pyrite forms in a variety of geological environments, including sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. It commonly forms through hydrothermal processes, where mineral-rich fluids deposit pyrite in veins, cavities, and other spaces within the host rock. Pyrite can also form in sedimentary environments, where it precipitates from sulfur-rich waters.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/pyrite1.png" alt="Pyrite Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Pyrite is often associated with other sulfide minerals, such as chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena, and can form as a replacement mineral in fossils and other organic material, creating pyritized fossils that are prized by collectors.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Pyrite's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) has an isometric crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic cubic and octahedral crystal forms. It has a hardness of 6 to 6.5 on the Mohs scale, making it relatively hard and resistant to scratching. Pyrite crystals are typically opaque and have a metallic luster, with a pale brass-yellow color that often tarnishes to a darker hue.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/pyrite2.png" alt="Pyrite Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Pyrite's most distinctive property is its high specific gravity, which makes it feel heavy for its size. It also produces a sulfurous smell when struck or heated, due to the release of sulfur compounds.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Pyrite</h2>
          <p>Pyrite is primarily used in the production of sulfuric acid, one of the most important industrial chemicals, which is produced by roasting pyrite to release sulfur dioxide. Pyrite is also used as a source of iron and as a polishing compound known as "tripoli." In addition, pyrite is sometimes used as a gemstone, where its metallic luster is showcased in jewelry.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/pyrite3.png" alt="Pyrite Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In the past, pyrite was used in the production of sparks for flintlock firearms, where its ability to produce sparks when struck made it an ideal material. Pyrite is also used in various metaphysical practices, where it is believed to have protective and grounding properties.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Pyrite in History</h2>
          <p>Pyrite has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily as a source of sulfur for various applications. The ancient Greeks and Romans used pyrite as a source of sulfur for medicinal and alchemical purposes, and it was also used in the production of sparks for fire-starting and firearms.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/pyrite4.png" alt="Historical Pyrite Use" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In modern times, pyrite continues to be a critical mineral in the production of sulfuric acid, making it an important industrial mineral. Its use as a gemstone and in metaphysical practices has also continued, making pyrite a versatile and valuable mineral in various industries.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Pyrite</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for pyrite involves searching for it in hydrothermal veins, sedimentary rock formations, and areas where sulfide minerals are common. Pyrite is often found in association with other sulfide minerals, making these regions promising for exploration.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/pyrite5.png" alt="Pyrite Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for pyrite, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Pyrite is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
