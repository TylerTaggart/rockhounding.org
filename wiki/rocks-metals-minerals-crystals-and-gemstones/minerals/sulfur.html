        <h1>Sulfur: The Bright Yellow Mineral</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Sulfur</h2>
          <p>Sulfur is a bright yellow, brittle mineral that is found in a variety of geological environments. It is composed of elemental sulfur (S) and is one of the most important industrial minerals, used in the production of sulfuric acid, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Sulfur is known for its distinct yellow color, strong odor, and association with volcanic activity.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, sulfur is a popular mineral to collect due to its vibrant color and unique crystal forms. It is often found in association with other minerals, such as gypsum, calcite, and barite, making it a valuable addition to any collection.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Sulfur Forms</h2>
          <p>Sulfur forms in a variety of geological environments, including volcanic regions, evaporite deposits, and hydrothermal veins. It typically forms through the oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as pyrite, or through the deposition of sulfur from volcanic gases. Sulfur can also form as a secondary mineral in sedimentary rocks, where it precipitates from sulfur-rich waters.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/sulfur1.png" alt="Sulfur Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Sulfur is often associated with other evaporite minerals, such as gypsum and anhydrite, and can form as a result of bacterial activity in organic-rich sediments, where it accumulates as a byproduct of bacterial sulfate reduction.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Sulfur's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Sulfur (S) has an orthorhombic crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic prismatic crystal habit. It has a hardness of 1.5 to 2.5 on the Mohs scale, making it relatively soft and brittle. Sulfur crystals are typically bright yellow, but they can also appear in shades of orange, red, or brown, depending on the presence of impurities.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/sulfur2.png" alt="Sulfur Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Sulfur is known for its distinct odor, which is often described as the smell of rotten eggs. This odor is caused by the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) gas, which is often associated with sulfur deposits. Sulfur is also highly flammable and burns with a blue flame, producing sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) gas.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Sulfur</h2>
          <p>Sulfur is primarily used in the production of sulfuric acid, one of the most important industrial chemicals, which is used in the manufacture of fertilizers, chemicals, and petroleum products. Sulfur is also used as a fungicide and pesticide in agriculture, where it helps to control plant diseases and pests.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/sulfur3.png" alt="Sulfur Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In addition to its industrial uses, sulfur is prized as a mineral specimen, where its bright yellow color and unique crystal forms are showcased in mineral collections. Sulfur is also used in the production of matches, explosives, and fireworks, where its flammability and chemical properties are utilized.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Sulfur in History</h2>
          <p>Sulfur has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily as a component in medicinal and alchemical practices. The ancient Egyptians used sulfur in their medicinal preparations, while the ancient Greeks and Romans used it in the production of fumigants and as a disinfectant.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/sulfur4.png" alt="Historical Sulfur Use" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In modern times, sulfur continues to be a critical mineral in the production of sulfuric acid, making it an important industrial mineral. Its use as a fungicide, pesticide, and in the production of matches and explosives has also continued, making sulfur a versatile and valuable mineral in various industries.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Sulfur</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for sulfur involves searching for it in volcanic regions, evaporite deposits, and areas where sulfide minerals are common. Sulfur is often found in association with other evaporite minerals, such as gypsum and anhydrite, making these regions promising for exploration.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/sulfur5.png" alt="Sulfur Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for sulfur, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Sulfur is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
