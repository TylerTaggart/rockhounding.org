        <h1>Dolomite: The Rock-Forming Mineral</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Dolomite</h2>
          <p>Dolomite is a common and significant rock-forming mineral known for its role in the formation of dolostone and dolomitic marble. It is composed of calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and is found in a wide range of geological settings, including sedimentary, metamorphic, and hydrothermal environments.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, dolomite is an interesting mineral to collect due to its wide variety of crystal forms and colors. It is often found alongside other minerals such as calcite, fluorite, and quartz, making it a valuable addition to any collection.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Dolomite Forms</h2>
          <p>Dolomite forms primarily through the alteration of limestone or lime mud by magnesium-rich groundwater, a process known as dolomitization. This process typically occurs in sedimentary environments where magnesium ions replace calcium ions in the limestone, resulting in the formation of dolomite. This mineral can also form in hydrothermal veins and as a secondary mineral in igneous rocks.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/dolomite1.png" alt="Dolomite Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Dolomite is often associated with limestone, but it is more resistant to weathering and erosion, which allows it to persist in the geological record. It is also found in metamorphic rocks, such as dolomitic marble, formed through the recrystallization of dolostone under high pressure and temperature conditions.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Dolomite's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) has a trigonal crystal structure, similar to calcite, but with magnesium replacing some of the calcium in the structure. This gives dolomite its distinct properties, including a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale and a lower reactivity to acid compared to calcite.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/dolomite2.png" alt="Dolomite Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Dolomite crystals are typically rhombohedral in shape, and they can vary in color from white to pink, gray, or even brown. The mineral's relatively high density and resistance to acid make it useful in a variety of industrial applications, including as a building material and in the production of magnesium oxide.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Dolomite</h2>
          <p>Dolomite is widely used in construction as a component of concrete and asphalt, where it provides durability and resistance to weathering. It is also used as a flux in the production of steel and glass, where it helps to remove impurities and reduce energy consumption.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/dolomite3.png" alt="Dolomite Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In agriculture, dolomite is used as a soil conditioner to neutralize acidic soils and supply essential nutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, to plants. Dolomite is also used in the production of ceramics, where it adds strength and reduces shrinkage during firing.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Dolomite in History</h2>
          <p>Dolomite was first described in 1791 by the French naturalist DÃ©odat Gratet de Dolomieu, after whom the mineral and the Dolomite Alps in northern Italy are named. The recognition of dolomite as a distinct mineral led to the understanding of the process of dolomitization and its significance in the geological record.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/dolomite4.png" alt="Historical Dolomite" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Throughout history, dolomite has been used as a building material, particularly in the construction of temples, statues, and other structures that require durability and resistance to weathering. Its use in agriculture and industry has expanded over time, making dolomite an essential mineral in modern applications.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Dolomite</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for dolomite involves searching for it in sedimentary rock formations, particularly in areas where limestone has been altered by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite can also be found in hydrothermal veins and metamorphic rocks, often in association with other minerals such as calcite, quartz, and fluorite.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/dolomite5.png" alt="Dolomite Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for dolomite, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Dolomite is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
