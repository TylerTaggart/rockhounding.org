        <h1>Gypsum: The Essential Mineral for Construction</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Gypsum</h2>
          <p>Gypsum is a widely used mineral known for its importance in construction, agriculture, and industrial applications. It is composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O) and is found in various forms, including selenite, alabaster, and satin spar. Gypsum is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth and can form in a variety of environments.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, gypsum is an interesting mineral to collect due to its soft, flexible crystals and diverse forms. It is often found in sedimentary rock formations, particularly in areas with evaporite deposits.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Gypsum Forms</h2>
          <p>Gypsum forms primarily in sedimentary environments where it precipitates from evaporating saline waters, such as in lagoons, salt flats, and shallow seas. As the water evaporates, calcium and sulfate ions combine to form gypsum crystals, which can grow to impressive sizes in certain conditions.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gypsum1.png" alt="Gypsum Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Gypsum can also form in hydrothermal veins and as a secondary mineral in some volcanic rocks. In arid regions, gypsum can accumulate as large deposits known as evaporite beds, which are mined for various industrial uses.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Gypsum's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O) has a monoclinic crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic tabular or prismatic crystal habit. It is relatively soft, with a hardness of 2 on the Mohs scale, making it easy to scratch with a fingernail. Gypsum crystals are often colorless or white, but they can also appear in shades of yellow, brown, or gray due to impurities.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gypsum2.png" alt="Gypsum Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>One of gypsum's most notable properties is its flexibility, particularly in the form of selenite, where thin sheets can be bent without breaking. Gypsum is also slightly soluble in water, which allows it to be easily shaped and used in various applications.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Gypsum</h2>
          <p>Gypsum is most commonly used in the construction industry as a primary component of plaster and drywall, where it provides fire resistance and sound insulation. It is also used in the production of cement, where it acts as a setting retarder, and in agriculture as a soil conditioner to improve soil structure and fertility.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gypsum3.png" alt="Gypsum Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In addition to its industrial uses, gypsum is prized as an ornamental stone, particularly in the form of alabaster, which is carved into statues, vases, and other decorative objects. Gypsum is also used in the production of fertilizers, toothpaste, and as a filler in various products, including paints and paper.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Gypsum in History</h2>
          <p>Gypsum has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily in construction. The ancient Egyptians used gypsum plaster in the construction of the pyramids and other monuments, and it was also used as a building material in ancient Rome. The use of gypsum in plaster and stucco continued throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gypsum4.png" alt="Historical Gypsum Artifacts" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Gypsum's importance in construction grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries with the development of drywall, which revolutionized the building industry. Today, gypsum remains a critical material in construction, agriculture, and various industrial applications, making it one of the most versatile and widely used minerals.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Gypsum</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for gypsum involves searching for it in sedimentary rock formations, particularly in areas where evaporite deposits are common. Gypsum can also be found in hydrothermal veins and volcanic rocks, often in association with other evaporite minerals such as halite and anhydrite.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gypsum5.png" alt="Gypsum Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for gypsum, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Gypsum is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
