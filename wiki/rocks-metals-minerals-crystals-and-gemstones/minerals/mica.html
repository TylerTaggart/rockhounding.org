        <h1>Mica: The Shiny, Layered Mineral</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Mica</h2>
          <p>Mica is a group of silicate minerals known for their sheet-like structure and shiny, reflective surfaces. The most common types of mica are muscovite and biotite, each of which has unique properties and applications. Mica is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, making it a common mineral in various geological environments.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, mica is a popular mineral to collect due to its distinctive layered structure and ability to cleave into thin, flexible sheets. It is often found in association with other minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, making it a valuable addition to any collection.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Mica Forms</h2>
          <p>Mica forms in a variety of geological environments, including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. It typically forms during the cooling and solidification of magma, where it crystallizes from silicate-rich fluids. Mica can also form during the metamorphism of clay-rich sediments, where it develops as a result of the heat and pressure associated with metamorphic processes.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/mica1.png" alt="Mica Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In sedimentary environments, mica can be deposited as part of clastic sediments, where it is often found in sandstones and shales. The mineral's ability to withstand weathering allows it to persist in the geological record, making it a common mineral in various rock types.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Mica's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Mica is a group of phyllosilicate minerals with a layered, sheet-like structure. This structure gives mica its characteristic cleavage, allowing it to split into thin, flexible sheets. The hardness of mica varies between 2 and 4 on the Mohs scale, depending on the specific type of mica.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/mica2.png" alt="Mica Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Mica's most notable property is its ability to cleave into thin, flexible sheets, which are often used in industrial applications. The mineral's shiny, reflective surfaces make it a popular material in cosmetics, where it is used to add shimmer to makeup products.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Mica</h2>
          <p>Mica is widely used in industry as an insulator in electrical and electronic equipment, where its ability to withstand high temperatures and resist electrical conductivity makes it an ideal material. Mica is also used as a filler in paints, plastics, and rubber, where it improves the material's properties and reduces costs.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/mica3.png" alt="Mica Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In addition to its industrial uses, mica is prized as a decorative material in cosmetics, where it is used to add shimmer and sparkle to makeup products. Mica is also used in the production of heat-resistant glass and ceramics, where it adds strength and durability to the final product.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Mica in History</h2>
          <p>Mica has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily as a decorative material. The ancient Egyptians used mica in their cosmetics, where it was used to add shimmer to makeup and other beauty products. Mica was also used as a material for windows and lamps in the ancient world, where its ability to withstand high temperatures made it a valuable material.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/mica4.png" alt="Historical Mica Use" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In modern times, mica continues to be a critical material in the electrical and electronics industries, where it is used as an insulator in a variety of applications. Its use in cosmetics and decorative materials has also continued, making mica a versatile and valuable mineral in various industries.</p>

        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Mica</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for mica involves searching for it in igneous and metamorphic rock formations, such as granite, schist, and gneiss. Mica is often found in association with other minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, making these regions promising for exploration.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/mica5.png" alt="Mica Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for mica, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Mica is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
