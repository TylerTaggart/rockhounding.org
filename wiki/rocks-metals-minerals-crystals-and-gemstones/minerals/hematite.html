        <h1>Hematite: The Iron Ore Mineral</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Hematite</h2>
          <p>Hematite is an iron oxide mineral (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and one of the most important sources of iron ore. Known for its metallic luster and reddish streak, hematite is a common mineral found in a variety of geological settings. It is widely used in the production of iron and steel, making it a critical mineral in modern industry.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, hematite is a popular mineral to collect due to its distinctive metallic sheen and varied crystal forms, including botryoidal, massive, and crystalline habits.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Hematite Forms</h2>
          <p>Hematite forms through a variety of geological processes, including direct precipitation from hydrothermal fluids, oxidation of other iron minerals, and as a result of metamorphic processes. It is commonly found in sedimentary environments, where it forms iron-rich layers, and in metamorphic rocks, where it develops from the alteration of iron-bearing minerals.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/hematite1.png" alt="Hematite Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Hematite is also found in hydrothermal veins, where it forms in association with other minerals such as quartz and magnetite. In some cases, hematite can form as a secondary mineral in weathered iron-rich rocks, creating ironstone deposits.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Hematite's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) has a trigonal crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic metallic luster and hardness of 5.5 to 6.5 on the Mohs scale. Hematite crystals can be tabular, rhombohedral, or platy in shape, and the mineral is often found in botryoidal or massive forms.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/hematite2.png" alt="Hematite Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>One of hematite's most distinctive properties is its red streak, which is often used as a diagnostic tool for identifying the mineral. Hematite is also strongly magnetic, particularly when heated, making it useful in various industrial applications.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Hematite</h2>
          <p>Hematite is the primary ore of iron and is used in the production of steel, one of the most important materials in modern construction and manufacturing. It is also used as a pigment, known as "red ochre," in paints, cosmetics, and art. Hematite's magnetic properties make it useful in electronics and as a heavy media in coal washing.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/hematite3.png" alt="Hematite Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In addition to its industrial uses, hematite is prized as a gemstone and ornamental stone. It is often cut into cabochons, beads, and carvings, where its metallic luster is showcased. Hematite is also used in metaphysical practices, where it is believed to have grounding and protective properties.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Hematite in History</h2>
          <p>Hematite has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily as a source of iron for tools and weapons. The ancient Egyptians used hematite as a pigment in their art and as a protective stone in jewelry. Hematite was also used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as a pigment and as a source of iron for their weapons and armor.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/hematite4.png" alt="Historical Hematite Use" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In modern times, hematite continues to be a critical mineral in the production of iron and steel, making it one of the most important minerals in the world. Its use as a pigment and ornamental stone has also continued, making hematite a versatile and valuable mineral.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Hematite</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for hematite involves searching for it in iron-rich rock formations, such as banded iron formations (BIFs), sedimentary iron deposits, and hydrothermal veins. Hematite is often found in association with other iron minerals, such as magnetite and goethite, making these regions promising for exploration.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/hematite5.png" alt="Hematite Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for hematite, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Hematite is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
