        <h1>Quartz: The Most Abundant Mineral</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Quartz</h2>
          <p>Quartz is one of the most abundant and widely distributed minerals on Earth. It is composed of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and is found in a variety of geological environments, including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Quartz is known for its hardness, durability, and resistance to weathering, making it a key component of many rock types and an essential mineral in various industries.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, quartz is a popular mineral to collect due to its variety of crystal forms and colors, including clear, milky, smoky, and amethyst varieties. It is often found in association with other minerals, such as feldspar and mica, making it a valuable addition to any collection.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Quartz Forms</h2>
          <p>Quartz forms in a variety of geological environments, including igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. It typically forms during the cooling and solidification of magma, where it crystallizes from silicate-rich fluids. Quartz can also form during the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks, where it develops as a result of the heat and pressure associated with metamorphic processes.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/quartz1.png" alt="Quartz Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In sedimentary environments, quartz can be deposited as part of clastic sediments, where it is often found in sandstones and conglomerates. The mineral's ability to withstand weathering allows it to persist in the geological record, making it a common mineral in various rock types.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Quartz's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has a hexagonal crystal structure, which gives it its characteristic prismatic crystal habit. It has a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, making it one of the hardest common minerals. Quartz crystals are typically clear or white, but they can also appear in a variety of colors, including pink (rose quartz), purple (amethyst), and brown (smoky quartz), depending on the presence of impurities.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/quartz2.png" alt="Quartz Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Quartz's most notable properties include its hardness, which makes it resistant to scratching, and its piezoelectric properties, which allow it to generate an electrical charge when subjected to mechanical stress. These properties make quartz a valuable material in various industrial applications.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Quartz</h2>
          <p>Quartz is widely used in industry as a raw material for the production of glass, ceramics, and abrasives. It is also used in the electronics industry, where its piezoelectric properties make it an essential component in devices such as oscillators, resonators, and pressure sensors. Quartz is also used as a gemstone, where its clarity and variety of colors are showcased in jewelry.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/quartz3.png" alt="Quartz Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In addition to its industrial uses, quartz is prized as a decorative material, where it is used to make countertops, flooring, and other architectural elements. Quartz is also used in metaphysical practices, where it is believed to have healing and amplifying properties.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Quartz in History</h2>
          <p>Quartz has been used by humans for thousands of years, primarily as a tool material. The ancient Egyptians used quartz to make jewelry, while the ancient Greeks and Romans used it to make tools, weapons, and decorative objects. Quartz was also used by the ancient Chinese in the production of ceramics and glass.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/quartz4.png" alt="Historical Quartz Use" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In modern times, quartz continues to be a critical material in the electronics and glass industries, making it one of the most important minerals in the world. Its use as a gemstone and in metaphysical practices has also continued, making quartz a versatile and valuable mineral in various industries.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Quartz</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for quartz involves searching for it in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock formations, such as granite, schist, and sandstone. Quartz is often found in association with other minerals, such as feldspar and mica, making these regions promising for exploration.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/quartz5.png" alt="Quartz Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for quartz, it is important to use proper tools, such as rock hammers and chisels, to extract specimens without damaging them. Quartz is relatively common and can be found in many locations worldwide.
