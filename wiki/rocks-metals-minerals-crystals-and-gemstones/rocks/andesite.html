        <h1>Andesite: The Fine-Grained Volcanic Rock</h1>

        <div class="infobox">
            <img src="../../wiki-images/Andesite.jpg" alt="Andesite" class="crystal-image">
            <p><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> Primarily SiO₂ (Silicon Dioxide) with feldspar, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals</p>
            <p><strong>Color:</strong> Grey, Black, Brown, Green</p>
            <p><strong>Hardness:</strong> 5.5-6 on the Mohs scale</p>
            <p><strong>Crystal System:</strong> Aphanitic (extrusive igneous rock)</p>
            <p><strong>Localities:</strong> Andes Mountains (South America), Japan, Indonesia, United States (Pacific Northwest)</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Andesite is a fine-grained volcanic rock that forms through the rapid cooling of magma at or near the Earth's surface, typically in volcanic regions. It is an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it solidifies from molten lava expelled during volcanic eruptions. Andesite is named after the Andes Mountains in South America, where it is commonly found.</p>
        <p>Andesite is intermediate in composition, containing minerals like plagioclase, pyroxene, and amphibole, which give it a range of colors from light to dark grey, black, brown, and green. Due to its hardness and durability, andesite is widely used in construction, road building, and decorative applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Formation and Types of Andesite</h2>
        <p>Andesite forms from magma that is intermediate in silica content (around 52-63%) and contains moderate amounts of iron, magnesium, and calcium. The rock is typically found in volcanic arcs associated with subduction zones, where an oceanic plate is forced beneath a continental plate. As the plate sinks and melts, magma is generated and erupts to form andesite.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Types of Andesite:</h3>
        
        <h3>1. Porphyritic Andesite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/PorphyriticAndesite.jpg" alt="Porphyritic Andesite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This type of andesite contains larger visible crystals (phenocrysts) embedded in a fine-grained matrix. The phenocrysts are often made of plagioclase, amphibole, or pyroxene.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Hornblende Andesite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/HornblendeAndesite.jpg" alt="Hornblende Andesite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Rich in hornblende (a type of amphibole mineral), this variety has a darker color and is often used for construction and road material due to its strength.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Pyroxene Andesite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/PyroxeneAndesite.jpg" alt="Pyroxene Andesite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Dominated by pyroxene minerals, pyroxene andesite tends to be darker in color and is commonly found in volcanic regions.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Dacitic Andesite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/DaciticAndesite.jpg" alt="Dacitic Andesite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>With a higher silica content, dacitic andesite bridges the gap between andesite and dacite, making it slightly lighter in color and often associated with explosive volcanic activity.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Basaltic Andesite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/BasalticAndesite.jpg" alt="Basaltic Andesite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This variety has a lower silica content and often forms from the partial melting of basaltic crust. It shares some characteristics with basalt but has a more intermediate composition.</p>
        
        <h2>Structure and Properties of Andesite</h2>
        <p>Andesite is characterized by its fine-grained texture and intermediate composition, which makes it distinct from more mafic rocks like basalt and more felsic rocks like rhyolite. The minerals in andesite crystallize rapidly as the lava cools, resulting in an aphanitic (fine-grained) texture, with larger phenocrysts sometimes present.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Andesite ranges from 5.5 to 6 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it relatively durable and suitable for construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Andesite is typically grey, but can range from dark brown to black or even green depending on its mineral content.</li>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> Andesite is generally dense and non-porous, but volcanic andesite can sometimes have small vesicles (gas bubbles) trapped within the rock.</li>
            <li><strong>Mineral Composition:</strong> Andesite contains plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, and amphibole, with minor amounts of quartz and biotite. The presence of different minerals can give andesite a range of textures and colors.</li>
        </ul>
