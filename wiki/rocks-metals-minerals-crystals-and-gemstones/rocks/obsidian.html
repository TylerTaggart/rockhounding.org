      <div class="infobox">
          <img src="../../wiki-images/obsidian.jpg" alt="Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
          <p><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> Primarily SiO₂ (Silicon Dioxide) but lacks a defined crystalline structure</p>
          <p><strong>Color:</strong> Typically black, though can be dark brown, green, red, or rainbow</p>
          <p><strong>Hardness:</strong> 5-5.5 on the Mohs scale</p>
          <p><strong>Crystal System:</strong> Amorphous (volcanic glass)</p>
          <p><strong>Localities:</strong> United States (Oregon, Arizona), Mexico, Iceland, Japan, and Italy</p>
          <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong> Tools, weapons, jewelry, ornamental objects, surgical instruments</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Introduction to Obsidian</h2>
      <p>Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felsic#:">felsic lava</a> cools rapidly without crystallizing. Its smooth glassy texture and sharp edges have made it highly valued by ancient cultures for tools and weapons, and today it remains popular for decorative objects and jewelry. Obsidian is an igneous rock that forms primarily at the edges of volcanic flows where the lava cools quickly, preventing the formation of a crystalline structure.</p>
      <p>Known for its striking black color, obsidian can also appear in a range of other hues depending on its chemical composition and the presence of trace elements or gas bubbles trapped during its formation. These varieties include red, green, mahogany, and rainbow obsidian, all of which are used in jewelry and for decorative purposes.</p>
      
      <h2>Formation and Types of Obsidian</h2>
      <p>Obsidian forms when felsic lava (rich in silica) erupts from a volcano and cools so quickly that the minerals do not have time to crystallize. This rapid cooling creates an amorphous glass-like texture. Obsidian is typically found near volcanic areas that experienced rhyolitic or andesitic eruptions.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Types of Obsidian:</h2>
      <h3>Black Obsidian</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/blackObsidian.jpg" alt="Black Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
      <p>The most common variety, black obsidian, forms from rapidly cooling lava and is often used for tools, weapons, and jewelry due to its sharp edges and deep color.</p>

      <h3>Rainbow Obsidian</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/rainbowObsidian.jpg" alt="Rainbow Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Characterized by its iridescent colors, rainbow obsidian is formed by the inclusion of gas bubbles or mineral impurities during its cooling process. It is highly valued for ornamental objects and jewelry.</p>

      <h3>Mahogany Obsidian</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/mahoganyObsidian.jpg" alt="Mahogany Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
      <p>This variety has streaks of reddish-brown and black, giving it a wood-like appearance. It is often used in carvings and jewelry due to its striking color contrasts.</p>

      <h3>Snowflake Obsidian</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/snowflakeObsidian.jpg" alt="Snowflake Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Snowflake obsidian contains white or grey inclusions of cristobalite, a type of silica, which form "snowflake" patterns within the black volcanic glass. It is popular for its unique appearance and metaphysical properties.</p>

      <h3>Sheen Obsidian (Golden or Silver)</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/silverSheenObsidian.jpg" alt="Sheen Obsidian" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Sheen obsidian has a metallic luster caused by gas bubbles arranged in layers during its formation. This shimmering effect makes it a favorite for jewelry and decorative pieces.</p>
      
      <h2>Structure and Properties of Obsidian</h2>
      <p>Obsidian lacks the internal crystalline structure found in most rocks, classifying it as an amorphous solid or volcanic glass. This unique structure gives obsidian its sharp edges, which have been used throughout history for tools and weapons.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Obsidian rates between 5 and 5.5 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it relatively soft compared to other igneous rocks. However, its glassy nature allows it to fracture into extremely sharp edges.</li>
          <li><strong>Color:</strong> While typically black, obsidian can appear in a variety of colors including red, green, and iridescent hues depending on trace minerals and gas bubbles trapped within the glass.</li>
          <li><strong>Fracture:</strong> Obsidian exhibits a <a href="https://www.rockngem.com/conchoidal-fracture-lucky-break/">conchoidal fracture</a>, meaning it breaks into smooth curved surfaces, which can form extremely sharp edges.</li>
          <li><strong>Luster:</strong> Obsidian has a glassy, vitreous luster that enhances its appeal in jewelry and decorative objects.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Uses of Obsidian</h2>
