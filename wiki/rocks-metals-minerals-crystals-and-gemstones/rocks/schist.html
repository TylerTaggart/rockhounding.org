      <h2>Introduction to Schist</h2>
      <p>Schist is a medium-grade metamorphic rock characterized by its foliated structure, which means it has a layered appearance due to the alignment of platy minerals such as mica. The word "schist" is derived from the Greek word "schízein," meaning "to split," highlighting its tendency to split into thin flat sheets. This foliation occurs due to the intense heat and pressure that act on precursor rocks such as shale during regional metamorphism.</p>
      <p>Schist has been widely used throughout history for construction, decorative purposes, and even gemstone production. Its unique texture, formed from a variety of minerals, makes it an attractive and versatile material for many industrial and artistic applications.</p>
      
      <h2>Formation and Types of Schist</h2>
      <p>Schist forms when pre-existing rocks such as shale or mudstone undergo regional metamorphism, a process involving extreme pressure and heat over long periods. This causes the minerals in the rock to recrystallize and align in parallel layers, creating the distinctive foliated texture. Schist often contains significant amounts of mica, which gives it a shiny, reflective surface.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Types of Schist:</h3>
      <h3>1. Mica Schist</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/micaSchist.jpg" alt="Mica Schist" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Rich in mica minerals, this is the most common variety of schist. It splits easily into thin layers and has a shiny appearance due to its high mica content.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Garnet Schist</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/garnetSchist.jpg" alt="Garnet Schist" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Garnet schist contains visible garnet crystals, making it a sought-after rock for both decorative and gemstone uses. The garnet crystals are often embedded in a matrix of mica or quartz.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Chlorite Schist</h3>
