      <h2>Introduction to Slate</h2>
      <p>Slate is a fine-grained foliated metamorphic rock formed from the low-grade metamorphism of shale, clay, or volcanic ash. Known for its characteristic ability to break into thin flat sheets, slate has been used for centuries in construction, particularly for roofing and flooring. Its durability, weather resistance, and aesthetic appeal make it a sought-after material in various industries.</p>
      <p>Slate's formation process imbues it with a distinct layered structure or foliation, which allows it to split easily along parallel planes. This property has made slate popular in architectural and decorative applications, as well as in everyday objects like chalkboards and pool tables.</p>
      
      <h2>Formation and Types of Slate</h2>
      <p>Slate forms through a process of <a href="https://www2.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens212/typesmetamorph.htm#:">low-grade metamorphism</a>, typically from sedimentary rocks like shale. Over time, heat and pressure alter these rocks, causing the alignment of their mineral grains in a process called foliation. This results in the distinctive layered appearance of slate.</p>
