        <h2>Introduction to Sandstone</h2>
        <p>Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of sand-sized mineral particles, mostly <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/gem-mining/quartz.html">quartz</a>. This rock forms through the compaction and cementation of sand particles over long geological periods, often in riverbeds, beaches, and deserts. The durability and abundance of sandstone have made it a cornerstone material for construction from ancient civilizations to modern architecture.</p>

        <p>Known for its unique texture and color variations, sandstone is highly versatile, used in buildings, pavements, sculptures, and even as an aquifer in groundwater storage. Its aesthetic appeal and workability make it a favored material across the world.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Sandstone</h2>
        <p>Sandstone forms as a result of the deposition, compaction, and cementation of sand grains. Over time, these particles, often sourced from quartz and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feldspar">feldspar</a>, are bonded together by minerals like silica, calcite, or iron oxides, creating sandstone. The environment where sandstone forms, such as deserts, rivers, or oceans, can influence its appearance and composition.</p>

        <h2>Key Types of Sandstone:</h2>

        <h3>1. Quartz Sandstone</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/quartzSandstone.jpg" alt="Quartz Sandstone" class="crystal-image">
