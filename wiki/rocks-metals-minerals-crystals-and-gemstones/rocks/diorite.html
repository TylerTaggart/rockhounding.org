        </div>
      
        <p>Diorite is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock formed when magma cools slowly beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to develop. It is classified as an intermediate rock, having a mineral composition that falls between mafic rocks like gabbro and felsic rocks like granite. Diorite is most easily recognized by its "salt-and-pepper" appearance, which results from the contrasting colors of its primary minerals: white or light plagioclase feldspar and dark amphibole or biotite. Its durability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular material in construction and art.</p>
        <p>Diorite is less common than granite but is still found in significant amounts in various parts of the world, particularly in regions with volcanic activity. It has been used since antiquity, both as a functional building material and for ornamental purposes in sculptures and monuments.</p>
      
        <h2>Formation and Types of Diorite</h2>
        <p>Diorite forms from the slow crystallization of magma beneath the Earth’s surface. Its formation is typically associated with volcanic arcs and subduction zones, where oceanic plates are forced beneath continental plates. The magma that forms diorite is intermediate in composition, meaning it contains moderate amounts of silica and a balance of light and dark minerals.</p>
      
        <h3>Key Types of Diorite:</h3>
      
        <h3>1. Leucodiorite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/Leucodiorite.jpg" alt="Leucodiorite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This variety of diorite contains a higher percentage of plagioclase feldspar and fewer dark minerals, giving it a lighter appearance compared to standard diorite.</p>
      
        <h3>2. Ferrodiorite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/Ferrodiorite.jpg" alt="Ferrodiorite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Rich in iron-bearing minerals like pyroxene and amphibole, ferrodiorite is darker in color and often found in regions with volcanic activity. It is typically harder and denser than other varieties.</p>
      
        <h3>3. Quartz Diorite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/QuartzDiorite.jpg" alt="Quartz Diorite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Quartz diorite contains <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/quartz-gemstones/index.html">quartz</a> in addition to the standard plagioclase and dark minerals, giving it a more felsic composition and making it closer in composition to granite.</p>
      
        <h3>4. Microdiorite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/Microdiorite.jpg" alt="Microdiorite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>A fine-grained variety of diorite, microdiorite forms when magma cools more quickly, resulting in smaller crystal sizes. It is often used in road construction and as a building stone.</p>
      
        <h3>5. Porphyritic Diorite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/PorphyriticDiorite.jpg" alt="Porphyritic Diorite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This type of diorite contains larger crystals known as phenocrysts embedded in a finer-grained groundmass. The phenocrysts typically consist of plagioclase feldspar or amphibole.</p>
      
        <h2>Structure and Properties of Diorite</h2>
        <p>Diorite is known for its coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture, with visible crystals of <a href="https://geology.com/minerals/plagioclase.shtml">plagioclase feldspar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibole">amphibole</a>, and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/earth-sciences-museum/resources/detailed-rocks-and-minerals-articles/pyroxenes#:">pyroxene</a>. It often has a "salt-and-pepper" appearance due to the contrast between its light and dark mineral components. This texture and coloration make diorite distinctive and easily recognizable.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Diorite ranges from 5.5 to 6.5 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it a hard and durable rock suitable for construction and sculpture.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Diorite is typically grey with a mix of white and black minerals, though it can range from nearly white (in leucodiorite) to dark grey or black (in ferrodiorite).</li>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> Diorite is generally dense and non-porous, making it highly resistant to weathering and erosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Mineral Composition:</strong> Diorite is composed primarily of plagioclase feldspar, with significant amounts of amphibole, pyroxene, and biotite. Quartz may also be present in quartz diorite varieties.</li>
