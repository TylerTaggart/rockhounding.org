            <img src="../../wiki-images/basalt.jpg" alt="Basalt" class="crystal-image">
            <p><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> Primarily composed of silicates such as pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase feldspar</p>
            <p><strong>Color:</strong> Dark grey to black</p>
            <p><strong>Hardness:</strong> 6 on the Mohs scale</p>
            <p><strong>Crystal System:</strong> Typically fine-grained aphanitic texture (igneous rock)</p>
            <p><strong>Localities:</strong> Found worldwide, particularly in volcanic regions like Iceland, Hawaii, the Columbia River Plateau (USA), and the Deccan Traps (India)</p>
            <p><strong>Common Uses:</strong> Construction (road base, cobblestones, building stones), sculptures, and insulation materials</p>
        </div>

        <p>Basalt is one of the most common and widespread igneous rocks on Earth, making up much of the oceanic crust and significant portions of continental crust. This dark-colored volcanic rock forms from the rapid cooling of lava at or near the Earth's surface, resulting in a fine-grained texture. Basalt has been used for thousands of years in various cultures for construction, tool-making, and artistic purposes due to its durability and abundance.</p>
        <p>Known for its dense, hard structure and dark appearance, basalt is primarily composed of silicate minerals such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroxene">pyroxene</a> and <a href="https://geology.com/minerals/olivine.shtml">olivine</a>, with <a href="https://commonminerals.esci.umn.edu/minerals-o-s/plagioclase-feldspar">plagioclase feldspar</a> adding a minor component. While its appearance may seem simple, basalt’s geological significance and cultural uses make it one of the most important rocks in the Earth’s history.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Basalt</h2>
        <p>Basalt forms through volcanic processes, typically at mid-ocean ridges, hotspots, or continental rift zones. When magma reaches the Earth’s surface through fissures or vents, it cools rapidly, forming the fine-grained basaltic rock.</p>

        <h2>Key Types of Basalt:</h2>
        <h3>Tholeiitic Basalt</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/tholeiiticBasalt.jpg" alt="Tholeiitic Basalt" class="crystal-image">
        <p>The most common type, it forms primarily at mid-ocean ridges and is rich in iron and magnesium but low in alkalis. Tholeiitic basalt is widespread in oceanic crust formations.</p>

        <h3>Alkaline Basalt</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/alkalineBasalt.jpg" alt="Alkaline Basalt" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Richer in sodium and potassium, this type is often found in continental rift zones and volcanic islands. Alkaline basalts are typically formed after tholeiitic basalt in volcanic settings.</p>

        <h3>Pillow Basalt</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/pillowBasalt.jpg" alt="Pillow Basalt" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Formed when basaltic lava erupts underwater, this variety takes on a characteristic pillow-like shape. Pillow basalts are commonly found on the ocean floor and volcanic island chains.</p>

        <h3>Flood Basalt</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/floodBasalt.jpg" alt="Flood Basalt" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Resulting from massive volcanic eruptions, flood basalts cover vast areas, sometimes spanning millions of square kilometers. The Columbia River Basalt Group in the USA and the Deccan Traps in India are examples of such formations.</p>

        <h2>Structure and Properties of Basalt</h2>
        <p>Basalt’s fine-grained crystalline structure results from its rapid cooling at the Earth’s surface, making it a dense and durable rock. It typically contains microscopic crystals of minerals such as pyroxene, olivine, and feldspar.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> With a rating of 6 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, basalt is a relatively hard material suitable for industrial and construction applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Typically dark grey to black due to its high iron and magnesium content.</li>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> Basalt is generally dense, but some varieties may contain vesicles (small holes) formed by gas bubbles trapped in the rock during solidification.</li>
            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Basalt is mostly fine-grained (aphanitic), although some forms may display a porphyritic texture with larger crystals embedded in a fine-grained matrix.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uses of Basalt</h2>
