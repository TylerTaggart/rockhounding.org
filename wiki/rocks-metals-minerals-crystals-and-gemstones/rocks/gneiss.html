      </div>
      
      <h2>Introduction to Gneiss</h2>
      <p>Gneiss is a high-grade metamorphic rock characterized by its distinctive banding and foliated structure, formed from the recrystallization of pre-existing rocks such as granite or sedimentary rocks like shale. Under intense heat and pressure, these precursor rocks undergo profound metamorphism, causing the minerals to segregate into layers, resulting in the characteristic "gneissic" banding.</p>
      <p>Gneiss is often visually striking due to its alternating light and dark mineral bands, which gives it a layered appearance. It can be found in a wide variety of colors including gray, white, pink, and black, depending on its mineral composition. Its durability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both structural and decorative purposes in construction.</p>
      
      <h2>Formation and Types of Gneiss</h2>
      <p>Gneiss forms under extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure, typically during regional metamorphism in mountain-building events. This rock can develop from the metamorphism of various rock types, including igneous rocks like granite or sedimentary rocks like sandstone or shale. As the rock undergoes metamorphism, minerals segregate into alternating layers of light and dark minerals, creating the signature banding.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Types of Gneiss:</h3>
      
      <h3>1. Orthogneiss</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/orthogneiss.jpg" alt="Orthogneiss" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Orthogneiss is formed from the metamorphism of igneous rocks, particularly granite. It contains feldspar and quartz, giving it a light color, often with bands of biotite or amphibole. Orthogneiss is generally lighter in color and exhibits a granitic texture.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Paragneiss</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/paragneiss.jpg" alt="Paragneiss" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Paragneiss is derived from the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks such as shale or sandstone. This variety tends to have a more varied mineral composition than orthogneiss, reflecting the original sedimentary composition.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Augen Gneiss</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/augenGneiss.jpg" alt="Augen Gneiss" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Augen gneiss features large eye-shaped mineral grains (called "augen," German for "eyes") typically of feldspar within the finer matrix of the rock. This distinctive texture results from the deformation of the original rock during metamorphism, causing the feldspar to recrystallize into large oval grains.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Banded Gneiss</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/bandedGneiss.jpg" alt="Banded Gneiss" class="crystal-image">
      <p>The most typical form, banded gneiss displays alternating bands of dark and light minerals. The light bands are usually composed of quartz and feldspar, while the darker bands contain mica, biotite, and amphibole. This texture results from the segregation of minerals during the metamorphic process.</p>
      
      <h2>Structure and Properties of Gneiss</h2>
      <p>Gneiss is known for its unique physical and mineralogical properties, which make it distinguishable from other metamorphic rocks.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Foliation:</strong> Gneiss exhibits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliation_(geology)#">foliated texture</a>, but unlike schist, its foliation is more coarse and often manifests as distinct bands of light and dark minerals.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> With a hardness of 6-7 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, gneiss is a hard and durable rock suitable for construction and outdoor applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Gneiss contains a variety of silicate minerals, primarily quartz and feldspar, which form the light bands, while biotite, amphibole, and garnet are found in the darker bands.</li>
          <li><strong>Banded Structure:</strong> The most characteristic feature of gneiss is its banded appearance. The bands are formed by the segregation of different mineral types during high-grade metamorphism. This banding can range from subtle to highly pronounced.</li>
          <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Gneiss is extremely durable, resistant to weathering and erosion, making it ideal for use in outdoor and high-traffic areas.</li>
      </ul>
