      <h2>Introduction to Flint</h2>
      <p>Flint is a hard sedimentary form of the mineral quartz (silicon dioxide) that has been historically significant for its use in making tools, weapons, and fire-starting implements. Known for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchoidal_fracture#:">conchoidal fracture</a>, which allows it to break into sharp-edged pieces, flint has played a crucial role in human evolution and technological advancement.</p>
      <p>Flint often forms in nodules or layers within sedimentary rocks like limestone or chalk. Its color ranges from grey to black but it can also be found in shades of brown, red, and yellow due to impurities like iron or organic material. Flint’s durability, sharpness, and ability to produce sparks make it one of the most important rocks in human history, particularly during the Stone Age.</p>
  
      <h2>Formation and Types of Flint</h2>
      <p>Flint forms through a process called diagenesis, where silica from marine organisms like sponges and diatoms precipitates into nodules or layers within sedimentary rocks, typically chalk or limestone. Over time, the silica hardens into cryptocrystalline quartz, creating the tough, glassy texture characteristic of flint.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Types of Flint:</h3>
      
      <h3>1. Black Flint</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/blackFlint.jpg" alt="Black Flint" class="crystal-image">
      <p>The most common variety, black flint is typically found in chalk or limestone deposits. It has been extensively used for tool-making and construction due to its hardness and sharp edges.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Grey Flint</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/greyFlint.jpg" alt="Grey Flint" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Grey flint is often found in northern Europe and is used both as a construction material and for tool-making. Its lighter color is due to different mineral impurities compared to black flint.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Brown Flint</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/brownFlint.jpg" alt="Brown Flint" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Brown flint contains higher levels of iron oxides, giving it a reddish-brown hue. It is found in regions like Egypt and is used decoratively and functionally.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Chert</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/Chert.jpg" alt="Chert" class="crystal-image">
      <p>While similar to flint, <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/beyond-flint-exploring-the-world-of-chert-rocks/index.html">chert</a> is more often found in limestone and can range in color. It shares many of the same properties as flint but is not always as sharp.</p>
  
      <h3>5. Fire Flint</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/fireFlint.jpg" alt="Fire Flint" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Known for its ability to generate sparks when struck against steel, fire flint was historically used in fire-starting tools including flintlock firearms.</p>
  
      <h2>Structure and Properties of Flint</h2>
      <p>Flint is a variety of <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/quartz-gemstones/index.html">quartz</a> and is known for its hard, glass-like structure. It is formed through the precipitation of silica, which creates an extremely fine-grained cryptocrystalline texture. Its unique fracture pattern makes it ideal for creating sharp tools and weapons.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Flint has a hardness of 6.5-7 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it durable and suitable for cutting tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Color:</strong> Flint is typically grey to black but can also appear in brown, red, or yellow hues due to the presence of organic material or mineral impurities.</li>
          <li><strong>Fracture:</strong> Flint exhibits conchoidal fracture, meaning it breaks into smooth curved surfaces. This property allows it to be knapped into sharp, precise edges.</li>
          <li><strong>Luster:</strong> Flint has a waxy to glassy luster when freshly broken, which dulls slightly with exposure to air.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Uses of Flint</h2>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/flintArrowheadsandSpear.jpg" alt="Flint Arrowheads" class="crystal-image">
