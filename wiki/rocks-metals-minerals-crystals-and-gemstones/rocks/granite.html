      </div>

      <p>Granite is one of the most widespread and extensively used rocks in human history. This durable, granular rock is an intrusive igneous formation, meaning it crystallizes from molten magma deep within the Earth's crust. Granite is primarily composed of three minerals: <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/gem-mining/quartz.html">quartz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feldspar">feldspar</a>, and <a href="https://mineralseducationcoalition.org/minerals-database/mica/">mica</a>, which give it a distinctive appearance and make it one of the hardest materials found naturally.</p>
      <p>Granite has been valued since antiquity for its strength, beauty, and resistance to weathering, making it a popular choice in architecture and construction. Its name is derived from the Latin word "granum," meaning grain, in reference to its coarse-grained structure. Over millennia, it has been used to build some of the most famous monuments and structures across various civilizations.</p>

      <h2>Formation and Types of Granite</h2>
      <p>Granite forms as molten magma cools slowly beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to develop. This process occurs over millions of years, often in tectonically active areas where plates converge. Granite is commonly found in large mountain ranges and is often exposed at the Earth's surface through uplift and erosion.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Types of Granite</h2>
      <h3>White Granite</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/whiteGranite.jpg" alt="White Granite" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Dominated by feldspar and quartz, this variety is commonly found in Europe and parts of North America. It is popular for kitchen countertops due to its clean, modern look.</p>

      <h3>Black Granite (Gabbro)</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/blackGranite.jpg" alt="Black Granite" class="crystal-image">
      <p>Despite being called "granite," black granite is technically a gabbro. It is composed mainly of <a href="https://geology.com/minerals/plagioclase.shtml#google_vignette">plagioclase</a> and <a href="https://www.mindat.org/min-9767.html">pyroxene</a>, offering a striking dark appearance ideal for monuments and gravestones.</p>

      <h3>Pink Granite</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/pinkGranite.jpg" alt="Pink Granite" class="crystal-image">
      <p>This variation is enriched with potassium feldspar, giving it a distinctive pink hue. Pink granite is commonly found in Brazil and parts of India, often used in decorative architecture.</p>

      <h3>Blue Granite</h3>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/blueGranite.jpg" alt="Blue Granite" class="crystal-image">
      <p>With a mix of quartz and feldspar, this rare type of granite has an attractive bluish tint. It's primarily sourced from quarries in Norway and South Africa.</p>

      <h2>Structure and Properties of Granite</h2>
      <p>Granite's structure is phaneritic, meaning its minerals are large enough to be distinguished by the naked eye. This rock is renowned for its durability, hardness, and resistance to abrasion, which makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Granite has a hardness of 6 to 7 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it a strong and long-lasting material.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Variations:</strong> The color of granite depends on the proportions of its constituent minerals. Quartz contributes to its translucence and hardness, feldspar gives it color, and mica adds sparkle.</li>
          <li><strong>Luster and Texture:</strong> Granite generally has a shiny, polished surface, though it can also be honed for a matte finish. Its texture is granular due to its interlocking crystals.</li>
          <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> Granite is relatively low in porosity but can absorb liquids over time if not sealed properly, particularly when used as a countertop material.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Uses of Granite</h2>
      <img src="../../wiki-images/mountRushmore.jpg" alt="Mount Rushmore" class="crystal-image">
