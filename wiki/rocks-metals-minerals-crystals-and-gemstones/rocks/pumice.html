        </div>

        <p>Pumice is an incredibly lightweight volcanic rock formed through the rapid cooling and depressurization of magma during explosive volcanic eruptions. Its porous, frothy structure is due to the gas bubbles trapped inside the lava as it cools, creating a highly vesicular texture. Because of its lightweight and buoyant nature, pumice can often be found floating on water after eruptions.</p>
        <p>Pumice has been valued since antiquity for a variety of uses, including in construction, abrasives, and personal care. Its abundance in volcanic regions and unique properties make it an important resource for industrial, cosmetic, and horticultural applications.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Pumice</h2>
        <p>Pumice forms when high-silica volcanic lava cools quickly while simultaneously releasing dissolved gases. The rapid cooling creates the rock's unique frothy texture, which is highly porous and lightweight. Pumice is commonly found in volcanic regions and is often produced during highly explosive eruptions of silica-rich lava.</p>

        <h2>Key Types of Pumice:</h2>
        <h3>White Pumice</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/whitePumice.jpg" alt="White Pumice" class="crystal-image">
        <p>White pumice is among the lightest and most commonly found varieties. It forms from highly siliceous lava and is often used in the production of lightweight concrete.</p>

        <h3>Grey Pumice</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/greyPumice.jpg" alt="Grey Pumice" class="crystal-image">
        <p>A slightly denser variety, grey pumice is still lightweight but may contain more minerals such as iron, giving it a darker color.</p>

        <h3>Pink or Reddish Pumice</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/reddishPumice.jpg" alt="Pink or Reddish Pumice" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This variety forms when iron-rich volcanic material cools, giving the pumice a pink or reddish hue. It is often used in landscaping and decorative applications.</p>

        <h3>Fine-Grain Pumice</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/fineGrainPumice.jpg" alt="Fine-Grain Pumice" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Sometimes referred to as "pumicite," this fine-grained form of pumice is used in polishing compounds and for its abrasive properties in cleaning products.</p>

        <h2>Structure and Properties of Pumice</h2>
        <p>Pumice is distinguished by its highly porous structure created as gas bubbles are trapped in the molten rock during volcanic eruptions. This unique texture gives pumice its lightweight, airy feel and makes it one of the few rocks that can float on water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Pumice has a hardness of around 6 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, but its brittle nature and porous texture make it much less durable than other volcanic rocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Pumice typically has a light color, including shades of white, grey, pale yellow, or pink, depending on the mineral content.</li>
            <li><strong>Density and Buoyancy:</strong> Pumice is so lightweight that it can float on water for long periods. The density of pumice is about 0.25–1.0 g/cm³.</li>
            <li><strong>Porosity:</strong> Pumice is highly porous, with up to 90% of its volume consisting of empty spaces, making it an excellent material for water retention in horticulture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uses of Pumice</h2>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/pumiceHorticulture.jpg" alt="Pumice for Horticulture" class="crystal-image">
