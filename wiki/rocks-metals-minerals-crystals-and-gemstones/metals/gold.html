        <h1>Gold: The Precious Metal of Kings</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Gold</h2>
          <p>Gold, a symbol of wealth and power throughout history, is one of the most coveted metals in the world. Known for its lustrous yellow hue and resistance to tarnish, gold has been used in various forms for millennia. Its unique properties, such as malleability, conductivity, and resistance to corrosion, make it invaluable in both jewelry and industrial applications.</p>
          <p>From ancient civilizations to modern times, gold has played a central role in economies, art, and culture. Whether worn as an ornament, used as currency, or valued as an investment, gold continues to hold a special place in human society.</p>
          <p>If you're eager to find gold in its natural state, be sure to explore our <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/gold-prospecting/prospecting-main.html">Gold Prospecting Maps</a>, which guide you to some of the best locations for finding gold in the wild!</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Gold Forms</h2>
          <p>Gold forms through a complex geological process that takes place deep within the Earth's crust. This metal is typically found in quartz veins, alluvial deposits, and as particles in riverbeds. The formation of gold occurs over millions of years through processes such as hydrothermal activity and volcanic eruptions.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gold1.png" alt="Gold Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Gold is often associated with quartz and other minerals, forming in veins as superheated fluids rich in gold and other metals seep into cracks in the Earth's crust. As these fluids cool, gold precipitates out and becomes concentrated in the veins. This slow, natural process results in the formation of gold deposits that can be mined.</p>
          <p>Gold is also found in placer deposits, where it has been eroded from primary sources and concentrated in riverbeds and alluvial plains. These deposits are often the target of prospectors and rockhounds searching for gold in its natural form.</p>

        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Gold's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Gold (Au) is a dense, soft, and malleable metal with a bright yellow color. It belongs to the cubic crystal system, and although it often forms in a massive, granular, or dendritic habit, well-formed crystals of gold are rare and highly prized by collectors.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gold2.png" alt="Gold Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Gold's density is one of the highest of all metals, with a specific gravity of 19.3. This characteristic, along with its resistance to oxidation and corrosion, contributes to its value and wide range of uses. Gold is a good conductor of electricity, making it indispensable in electronics, where it is used in connectors, switches, and other components.</p>
          <p>In addition to its physical properties, gold is chemically inert, meaning it does not react with most substances. This resistance to tarnish is one reason why gold remains shiny and attractive over time, even when exposed to harsh conditions.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Gold</h2>
          <p>Gold's uses are as varied as they are valuable. In jewelry, gold is prized for its beauty, rarity, and durability. It is often alloyed with other metals to increase its hardness and alter its color, resulting in variations such as white gold and rose gold. Gold jewelry remains a popular choice for wedding rings, necklaces, bracelets, and other adornments.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gold3.png" alt="Gold Jewelry" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Beyond jewelry, gold has significant industrial applications. Its excellent conductivity and resistance to corrosion make it essential in the electronics industry, where it is used in everything from computer chips to connectors. Gold is also used in dentistry, aerospace, and medicine, where its biocompatibility and malleability are crucial.</p>
          <p>Gold's value as an investment cannot be overstated. For centuries, gold has been seen as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty. It is traded globally, and its price is closely watched by investors and governments alike. Gold bullion, coins, and bars are popular forms of investment, with central banks holding large reserves to back their currencies.</p>

        <section id="history">
          <h2>Gold in History</h2>
          <p>Gold's allure is as old as civilization itself. It has been used in trade, adorned the bodies of the rich and powerful, and been the subject of myths and legends. The ancient Egyptians were among the first to mine gold on a large scale, using it to craft intricate jewelry, religious artifacts, and even the masks of their pharaohs.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/gold4.png" alt="Historical Gold" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Gold's role in history is not just limited to adornment. It has been used as a currency and a standard for trade for thousands of years. The discovery of gold in the Americas during the 16th century led to the age of exploration and colonization, as European powers sought to amass wealth from the New World.</p>
          <p>In more recent history, the Gold Rushes of the 19th century, particularly in California and Australia, drove mass migration and economic development. These events have left a lasting impact on the culture and history of the regions involved, with gold prospecting still popular among adventurers and rockhounds today.</p>
          <p>Gold's historical significance extends to its symbolic value. It has been associated with the divine, used in religious ceremonies, and represented wealth, power, and success. Today, gold continues to captivate the imagination, symbolizing both material wealth and the enduring human spirit of exploration.</p>
