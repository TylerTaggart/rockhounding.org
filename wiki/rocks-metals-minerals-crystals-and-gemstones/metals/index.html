      <h1>What is a Metal?</h1>
    
      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Metals</h2>
        <p>Metals are elements, compounds, or alloys that possess high electrical conductivity, malleability, and reflectivity. Metals are fundamental to modern technology, industry, and jewelry, and they are often categorized based on their properties and uses. Precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum are highly valued for their rarity and are often used in jewelry and currency. Other metals, such as copper, iron, and aluminum, are essential for construction, electronics, and various industrial applications.</p>
        <p>This page focuses on the different types of metals, with a particular emphasis on precious metals and their role in gold prospecting. You'll also find a comprehensive list of metals, ranging from the most common to the rarest, each with its own unique characteristics and uses.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="what-is-a-metal">
        <h2>What is a Metal?</h2>
        <p>In scientific terms, a metal is an element that readily loses electrons to form positive ions and has metallic bonds. Metals are known for their high conductivity, malleability, ductility, and often a shiny appearance. These properties make them incredibly versatile and indispensable in various industries, from construction and transportation to electronics and jewelry.</p>
        <p>Metals are generally divided into two broad categories: ferrous metals, which contain iron and are prone to rusting, and non-ferrous metals, which do not contain iron and are usually more resistant to corrosion. Within these categories, metals can be further classified based on their rarity and economic value, such as precious metals and base metals.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="precious-metals">
        <h2>Precious Metals</h2>
        <p>Precious metals are rare, naturally occurring metallic elements of high economic value. The most well-known precious metals include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. These metals are often used in jewelry, currency, and as investment assets due to their rarity, durability, and ability to retain value over time.</p>
        <p>Gold, in particular, has been prized throughout history for its beauty and malleability. It is often found in its native form, making it one of the few metals that can be used directly without processing. Gold prospecting remains a popular activity for rockhounds and enthusiasts who search for gold deposits in rivers, streams, and old mining sites.</p>
        <p>Silver is another precious metal with a rich history, valued for its luster and conductivity. It is commonly used in coins, jewelry, and electronics. Platinum and palladium, while less common, are essential in industries such as automotive manufacturing, where they are used in catalytic converters.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="gold-prospecting">
        <h2>Gold Prospecting and Maps</h2>
        <p>Gold prospecting is the search for gold deposits, typically found in rivers, streams, and old mining sites. Prospectors use a variety of tools and techniques to locate and extract gold, ranging from simple pans to advanced metal detectors and dredges.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in gold prospecting, Rockhounding.org offers detailed <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/gold-prospecting/prospecting-main.html">Gold Prospecting Maps</a> that highlight prime locations for finding gold. Whether you're a seasoned prospector or a beginner, these maps can guide you to some of the best spots for striking gold.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="modern-uses">
        <h2>Modern Uses of Metals</h2>
        <p>In today's world, metals are used in an array of applications, from construction and transportation to electronics and healthcare. Copper is essential in electrical wiring due to its excellent conductivity, while iron and steel are the backbone of the construction industry, used in buildings, bridges, and infrastructure projects.</p>
        <p>Aluminum, known for its light weight and resistance to corrosion, is widely used in the automotive and aerospace industries. Precious metals like platinum and palladium are crucial in the production of catalytic converters, which reduce harmful emissions from vehicles. The versatility and durability of metals continue to make them a cornerstone of modern civilization.</p>
