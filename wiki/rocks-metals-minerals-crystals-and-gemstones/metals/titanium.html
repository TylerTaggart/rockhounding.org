        <h1>Titanium: The Strong and Lightweight Metal</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Titanium</h2>
          <p>Titanium is a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant metal that has become indispensable in various high-performance applications. Known for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and biocompatibility, titanium is widely used in aerospace, medical, and marine industries. Despite its abundance in the Earth's crust, titanium is not found in its pure form in nature but is extracted from minerals such as ilmenite and rutile.</p>
          <p>For rockhounds, discovering titanium-bearing minerals is a rewarding experience. Titanium's unique properties and its role in modern technology make it a fascinating metal to explore and collect.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Titanium Forms</h2>
          <p>Titanium is primarily found in the minerals ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>) and rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>). These minerals form through igneous and metamorphic processes, often in areas with significant volcanic activity. Ilmenite is the most abundant titanium mineral and is typically found in large deposits of igneous rocks such as gabbro, basalt, and diorite.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/titanium1.png" alt="Titanium Ore Formation" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Rutile, on the other hand, is usually found in metamorphic rocks like schist and gneiss, where it forms as a result of high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Rutile can also occur as an accessory mineral in igneous rocks and is often concentrated in placer deposits, where it has been eroded from its original source and transported by water.</p>
          <p>Titanium is extracted from ilmenite and rutile through processes such as the Kroll process, where the minerals are converted into titanium tetrachloride and then reduced to pure titanium using magnesium or sodium. This process produces titanium metal, which is then used in various high-performance applications.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="structure">
          <h2>Titanium's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Titanium (Ti) is a silver-gray metal with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure at room temperature, known as alpha-phase titanium. When heated to higher temperatures, titanium transforms into a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, known as beta-phase titanium. This structural change gives titanium a unique combination of strength, flexibility, and corrosion resistance.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/titanium2.png" alt="Titanium Crystal Structure" class="crystal-image">
          <p>One of titanium's most notable properties is its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, making it as strong as steel but only about 60% as dense. This property is particularly valuable in aerospace and other applications where reducing weight is crucial without compromising strength.</p>
          <p>Titanium is also highly resistant to corrosion, even in harsh environments like seawater and acidic conditions. This corrosion resistance, combined with its biocompatibility, makes titanium an ideal material for medical implants, such as hip replacements and dental implants, where it integrates well with human tissue.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Titanium</h2>
          <p>Titanium's unique properties make it a key material in various high-performance industries. In aerospace, titanium is used extensively in the construction of aircraft, spacecraft, and jet engines, where its strength, light weight, and heat resistance are critical to performance and safety.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/titanium3.png" alt="Titanium Applications" class="crystal-image">
          <p>In the medical field, titanium's biocompatibility and corrosion resistance make it the material of choice for implants, prosthetics, and surgical instruments. Titanium implants are commonly used in orthopedic surgery, dental implants, and even in reconstructive procedures due to their ability to bond with bone and resist corrosion.</p>
          <p>Titanium is also used in the marine industry for building ships, submarines, and offshore platforms, where its resistance to seawater corrosion is essential. Additionally, titanium's strength and aesthetic appeal make it popular in consumer products like watches, eyeglass frames, and high-end sports equipment.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="history">
          <h2>Titanium in History</h2>
          <p>Titanium was first discovered in 1791 by the British clergyman and mineralogist William Gregor, who identified it in the mineral ilmenite. However, it was not until 1795 that the element was named "titanium" by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, after the Titans of Greek mythology, symbolizing its strength.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/titanium4.png" alt="Historical Titanium Artifacts" class="crystal-image">
          <p>Despite its discovery in the 18th century, titanium was not commercially produced until the 20th century, when the Kroll process was developed to extract pure titanium metal. This breakthrough made titanium more accessible for industrial use, leading to its widespread adoption in aerospace, military, and medical applications during and after World War II.</p>
          <p>Today, titanium continues to be valued for its unique combination of properties, making it a vital material in both advanced technology and everyday products. Its ongoing importance in various industries ensures that titanium will remain a key element in the development of future innovations.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="prospecting">
          <h2>Prospecting for Titanium</h2>
          <p>Prospecting for titanium involves searching for its primary minerals, ilmenite and rutile, in areas with a history of volcanic activity or significant metamorphism. Titanium-bearing minerals are often found in igneous and metamorphic rocks, as well as in placer deposits where they have been concentrated by water action.</p>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/titanium5.png" alt="Titanium Prospecting" class="crystal-image">
          <p>When prospecting for titanium, look for black sand beaches, riverbeds, or areas with heavy mineral deposits, where ilmenite and rutile can often be found mixed with other heavy minerals like magnetite. Geochemical tests and mineral identification techniques can help confirm the presence of titanium-bearing minerals in your samples.</p>
          <p>Although titanium is not as rare or valuable as some other metals, its widespread use and unique properties make it an exciting metal to discover. Collecting titanium ores offers rockhounds the opportunity to explore the geological processes that produce this important metal and to learn more about its applications in modern industry.</p>
