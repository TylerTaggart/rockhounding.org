      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Introduction to Citrine</h2>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/Raw Citrine Stone.jpg" alt="Citrine Stone" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Citrine, a gemstone known for its warm golden hues, has been cherished throughout history for its vibrant color and reputed metaphysical properties. This beautiful stone, a <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/quartz-gemstones/index.html">variety of quartz</a>, ranges in color from pale yellow to deep amber, evoking images of sunlight and warmth. Its name is derived from the French word "citron," meaning lemon, a nod to its yellow coloration. Citrine is often associated with wealth and prosperity, making it a popular choice for those seeking to attract success and abundance.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other gemstones, <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-citrine/index.html">natural citrine</a> is relatively rare. Most of the citrine on the market today is actually heat-treated <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/collecting-amethyst-meaning-uses-properties-guide/index.html">amethyst</a> or smoky quartz, which transforms its original color into the characteristic yellow or orange hues of citrine. Despite this, citrine remains a beloved gemstone for its affordability, durability, and striking appearance.</p>

      <section id="formation">
        <h2>How Citrine Forms</h2>
        <p>Citrine forms in the Earth's crust under specific geological conditions. Natural citrine is typically found in pegmatite veins, hydrothermal deposits, and as a result of volcanic activity. The formation process begins with silica-rich fluids, which, over millions of years, crystallize to form quartz. Citrine's distinct yellow color is primarily due to the presence of iron within the crystal structure, and the oxidation state of these iron impurities is key to the final color of the stone.</p>
        <p>Natural citrine is often found alongside amethyst and smoky quartz, as these stones share similar geological environments. However, due to the rarity of naturally occurring citrine, much of what is sold today is heat-treated amethyst or smoky quartz. When exposed to high temperatures (typically between 800-900°C), these stones can turn a rich golden color, mimicking that of natural citrine.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="structure">
        <h2>Citrine's Structure and Properties</h2>
        <p>Citrine shares the same basic structure as other quartz varieties, with the chemical formula SiO₂ (silicon dioxide). It belongs to the trigonal crystal system, which typically results in crystals forming as six-sided prisms. This crystalline structure allows citrine to refract light beautifully, especially when cut and polished for use in jewelry.</p>
        <p>With a hardness of 7 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, citrine is a durable gemstone suitable for a variety of applications. It is resistant to scratching and is often used in rings, necklaces, and other forms of jewelry that are subject to daily wear. However, like all quartz, citrine should be protected from harsh chemicals and extreme temperature changes to maintain its natural beauty.</p>
        <p>One of the most intriguing properties of citrine, shared with other quartz crystals, is its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity">piezoelectric quality</a>. When mechanical stress is applied to the crystal, it can generate an electric charge. This property is utilized in various technological applications, such as in pressure gauges, sensors, and electronic devices.</p>

        <h2>Uses of Citrine</h2>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/Cartier citrine and diamond brooch.jpg" alt="Citrine Jewelry" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Citrine has been used throughout history for both decorative and functional purposes. Its sunny color and affordable price make it a popular choice in jewelry, where it is often cut into faceted stones for rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets. Citrine pairs well with both yellow and white metals, making it a versatile option for various jewelry designs.</p>
        <p>Beyond its use in personal adornment, citrine has been employed in home décor. Polished citrine geodes and clusters are often displayed as decorative objects, adding a touch of natural elegance to interiors. Citrine is also used in the creation of figurines, bookends, and other ornamental items.</p>
        <p>In the metaphysical realm, citrine is often referred to as the "Merchant's Stone" due to its association with wealth and abundance. Many believe that keeping citrine in cash registers or wallets can attract financial success. It is also used in crystal healing practices, where it is thought to promote positive energy, clear negative thoughts, and enhance mental clarity.</p>

      <section id="history">
        <h2>Citrine in History and Culture</h2>
        <p>Citrine's history is as vibrant as its color. Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and Romans, valued citrine for its beauty and believed it possessed protective powers. Roman priests would often use citrine in rings, which they wore during ceremonies to symbolize the sun's power.</p>
        <p>During the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/node/171023#">Art Deco period</a> of the 1920s and 1930s, citrine saw a surge in popularity. Jewelers and designers of the time favored citrine for its bold color and used it extensively in rings, brooches, and necklaces, often alongside other brightly colored gemstones. Citrine's affordability allowed for the creation of large, statement pieces that became synonymous with the glamour and extravagance of the era.</p>
        <p>In modern times, citrine continues to be a popular gemstone for both jewelry and spiritual practices. It is the birthstone for November and is associated with the zodiac signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius. Citrine is also the traditional gemstone for the 13th wedding anniversary, symbolizing love and longevity.</p>
