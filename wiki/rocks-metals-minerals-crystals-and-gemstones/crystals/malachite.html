        </div>

        <p>Malachite is a striking green gemstone known for its vivid color and unique banded patterns. It has been prized for thousands of years both for its beauty and its supposed metaphysical properties. Composed of copper carbonate hydroxide, malachite forms in the oxidized zones of copper deposits, often growing alongside other copper minerals like azurite and chrysocolla.</p>
        <p>The name "malachite" comes from the Greek word "malakos," meaning soft, due to the stone's relatively low hardness. Its vibrant green color, reminiscent of lush vegetation, made malachite a favorite among ancient cultures, particularly in Egypt and Rome, where it was used in jewelry, amulets, and as a pigment for cosmetics and paint.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Malachite</h2>
        <p>Malachite forms through the weathering and oxidation of copper deposits. Over time, as copper ores are exposed to oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide, malachite crystallizes, often creating beautiful banded formations. These formations can appear in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botryoidal#">botryoidal (grape-like) clusters, stalactites</a>, or fibrous masses.</p>
        <P>There are several types of malachite, distinguished by their appearance and formation:</P>
        <h3>Botryoidal Malachite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/botryoidalMalachite.jpg" alt="Botryoidal Malachite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This type forms in rounded, bubble-like masses, often with concentric banding. It is one of the most common and recognizable forms of malachite.</p>

        <h3>Stalactitic Malachite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/stalactiticMalachite.jpg" alt="Stalactitic Malachite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Formed in cave-like environments, this type of malachite grows in elongated, cylindrical shapes, often with intricate banding. When sliced, it reveals stunning concentric patterns.</p>

        <h3>Fibrous Malachite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/fibrousMalachiteStone.jpg" alt="Fibrous Malachite" class="crystal-image">
        <p>This variety has a silky, fibrous structure that can display a <a href="https://geologybase.com/chatoyancy/">chatoyant effect</a> (cat's eye), adding to its visual appeal.</p>

        <h3>Malachite with Azurite</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/malachitewithAzurite.jpg" alt="Malachite with Azurite" class="crystal-image">
