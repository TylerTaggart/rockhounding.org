        <p>Diamond is the most well-known and coveted gemstone in the world, celebrated for its exceptional hardness, brilliance, and symbolic significance. Composed of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice, diamond is the hardest known natural material on Earth. This remarkable stone has been cherished for thousands of years not only for its beauty but also for its associations with love, power, and wealth.</p>
        <p>Diamonds are commonly associated with engagement rings, symbolizing eternal love and commitment. However, they are also prized in various industrial applications due to their unparalleled hardness. The word "diamond" is derived from the Greek word "adamas," meaning invincible or indestructible, reflecting the gemstone's supreme durability.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Diamond</h2>
        <p>Diamonds form deep within the Earth's mantle under extreme pressure and temperature conditions, typically at depths of 140 to 190 kilometers. The process takes millions to billions of years, with diamonds being brought to the surface through volcanic eruptions in a type of rock known as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/kimberlite">kimberlite.</a></p>
        <p>There are several types of diamonds classified based on their physical and chemical properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Diamonds:</strong> These are formed naturally over billions of years and are typically mined from kimberlite pipes or alluvial deposits.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthetic Diamonds:</strong> Also known as lab-grown or man-made diamonds, these are created in a controlled environment using high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) or <a href="https://www.queensmith.co.uk/diamond-guides/lab-grown-diamonds/cvd-diamonds-what-are-they#">chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods</a>. They are chemically and physically identical to natural diamonds but are produced much more quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Fancy Colored Diamonds:</strong> While most diamonds are colorless, some exhibit a range of colors due to the presence of trace elements or structural anomalies. These include blue, yellow, pink, and even red diamonds, with the intensity of the color significantly affecting their value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Structure and Properties of Diamond</h2>
        <p>Diamonds belong to the cubic (isometric) crystal system and have a face-centered cubic lattice structure. The unique arrangement of carbon atoms in a diamond gives it extraordinary properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Diamond ranks <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">10 on the Mohs scale</a>, making it the hardest known natural material. This hardness is due to the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Luster:</strong> Diamonds exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(mineralogy)#">adamantine luster</a>, which is the highest level of brilliance seen in any gemstone. This luster is a result of their high refractive index.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleavage:</strong> Diamonds have perfect cleavage in four directions, meaning they can be split along these planes. This property is both a benefit and a challenge in diamond cutting.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal Conductivity:</strong> Diamonds are excellent conductors of heat, which is why they feel cold to the touch and are used in various industrial applications.</li>
            <li><bold>Color:</bold> Most diamonds are colorless or have a slight yellow or brown tint. However, the presence of other elements can result in fancy colors such as blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), or pink (structural distortions).</li>
        </ul>
