        </div>

        <p>Sapphire is one of the most revered and sought-after gemstones in the world, renowned for its captivating blue color and rich history. A variety of the mineral corundum, sapphire can occur in almost every color of the rainbow except red (which is classified as ruby). The most iconic and valuable sapphires are a deep vivid blue, often associated with royalty, wisdom, and divine favor.</p>
        <p>The name "sapphire" comes from the Greek word "sappheiros," meaning blue stone. Sapphires have been cherished for thousands of years, symbolizing truth, loyalty, and nobility. Sapphire is one of the four precious gemstones, along with ruby, emerald, and diamond, and is the birthstone for September, representing purity, wisdom, and faithfulness.</p>

        <h2>Formation and Types of Sapphire</h2>
        <p>Sapphires form under extreme conditions of heat and pressure in metamorphic rocks such as schist and gneiss, as well as in igneous rocks like basalt. The trace elements present during the stone's formation determine the color of the sapphire, with iron and titanium giving rise to the classic blue hue.</p>

        <p>There are several types of sapphire, categorized by their color, origin, and quality:</p>
        <h3>Blue Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/blueSapphire.jpg" alt="Blue Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>The most famous and sought-after variety, blue sapphire ranges in color from pale blue to deep vivid blue. The most valuable blue sapphires are known as "cornflower blue," a bright medium to deep blue with high saturation.</p>

        <h3>Padparadscha Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/padparadschaSapphire.jpg" alt="Padparadscha Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>One of the rarest and most valuable types of sapphire, padparadscha sapphires are a unique pinkish-orange color named after the color of a lotus flower. They are primarily found in Sri Lanka and are highly prized by collectors.</p>

        <h3>Fancy Sapphires</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/fancySapphires.jpg" alt="Fancy Sapphires" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Sapphires that occur in colors other than blue are known as fancy sapphires. These include yellow, pink, green, purple, and orange sapphires, each valued for its unique color and rarity.</p>

        <h3>Star Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/starOfIndia.jpg" alt="Star Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Star sapphires exhibit asterism, a star-like pattern on the surface of the stone caused by light reflecting off needle-like inclusions of rutile. These sapphires are typically cut as cabochons to enhance the star effect.</p>

        <h3>White Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/whiteSapphire.jpg" alt="White Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>White sapphires are colorless and can be a more affordable alternative to diamonds. They are often used in jewelry and are valued for their brilliance and durability.</p>

        <h2>Structure and Properties of Sapphire</h2>
        <p>Sapphire belongs to the trigonal crystal system and is composed of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) with trace elements that give it its color. It is known for its exceptional hardness, brilliance, and range of colors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> Sapphire has a hardness of 9 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making it one of the hardest gemstones, second only to diamond. This durability makes sapphire an excellent choice for all types of jewelry, particularly engagement rings and bracelets.</li>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Sapphires can occur in nearly every color, but blue is the most iconic. The color of sapphire is determined by the trace elements present during its formation, with iron and titanium creating blue, chromium producing pink, and vanadium yielding purple.</li>
            <li><strong>Luster:</strong> Sapphire exhibits a vitreous (glassy) luster when polished, giving it a bright, reflective surface. This luster enhances the stone's natural beauty and brilliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> High-quality sapphires are typically eye-clean, meaning they have no visible inclusions to the naked eye. However, most sapphires contain some inclusions, which are considered acceptable as long as they do not significantly impact the stone's transparency or color.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uses of Sapphire</h2>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/sapphireRings.jpg" alt="Sapphire Jewelry" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Sapphire has been used for various purposes throughout history, from jewelry to symbolic and protective talismans:</p>

        <h2>History of Sapphire</h2>
        <p>The history of sapphire is rich and spans several cultures and periods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient Persia:</strong> The ancient Persians believed that the earth rested on a giant sapphire, and its reflection was what made the sky blue. Sapphires were considered sacred and were often used in religious ceremonies.</li>
            <li><strong>Medieval Europe:</strong> During the Middle Ages, sapphires were believed to protect against envy and harm. They were worn by clergy as symbols of heaven and used in church decoration. Sapphires were also thought to bring peace and spiritual enlightenment.</li>
            <li><strong>Royalty and Nobility:</strong> Sapphires have long been associated with royalty and nobility. The British Crown Jewels feature several famous sapphires, including the St. Edward's Sapphire, which is set in the Imperial State Crown. Princess Diana's engagement ring, featuring a blue sapphire surrounded by diamonds, further cemented the gemstone's association with royalty.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Unusual Varieties of Sapphire</h2>
        <p>In addition to the well-known blue sapphires, there are some unusual and rare forms:</p>
        <h3>Padparadscha Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/padparadschaSapphire.jpg" alt="Padparadscha Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Padparadscha sapphires are a unique pinkish-orange color, often described as a blend of lotus flower and sunset hues. These sapphires are incredibly rare and are primarily found in Sri Lanka.</p>

        <h3>Color-Change Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/purpleSapphire.jpg" alt="Color-Change Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Some sapphires exhibit a color-change effect, appearing blue in natural light and purple under incandescent light. This phenomenon is rare and adds to the stone's desirability.</p>

        <h3>Trapiche Sapphire</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/trapicheSapphire.jpg" alt="Trapiche Sapphire" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Trapiche sapphires display a star-like pattern with six spokes radiating from a central core. This pattern is caused by the presence of inclusions and is named after the spoked wheels used in sugar mills ("trapiche" in Spanish).</p>

        <h3>Fancy Sapphires</h3>
        <img src="../../wiki-images/fancySapphires.jpg" alt="Fancy Sapphires" class="crystal-image">
        <p>Sapphires that occur in colors other than blue, such as yellow, pink, green, and purple, are known as fancy sapphires. These stones are valued for their unique colors and are often used in bespoke jewelry.</p>

        <h2>Enhancement of Sapphire</h2>
        <p>To enhance its appearance and durability, sapphires may undergo various treatments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat Treatment:</strong> Heat treatment is the most common enhancement for sapphires, used to improve color and clarity. This treatment is stable and permanent, and it is widely accepted in the industry. Heat-treated sapphires should be disclosed to buyers.</li>
            <li><strong>Fracture Filling:</strong> Some sapphires have fractures that are filled with lead glass or other materials to improve their clarity. This treatment enhances the stone's appearance but should be disclosed as filled sapphires are less valuable than untreated stones.</li>
            <li><strong>Diffusion Treatment:</strong> Diffusion treatment involves the use of high temperatures and chemicals to enhance the color of the sapphire. This treatment is less common and should be disclosed as it only affects the surface of the stone and may wear off over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Beryllium Treatment:</strong> Beryllium treatment is used to create or enhance the color of fancy sapphires, particularly yellow and orange varieties. This treatment can penetrate deeper into the stone than traditional diffusion and should be disclosed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Caring for Sapphire</h2>
        <p>Sapphire requires proper care to maintain its beauty and prevent damage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong><a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/crystal-cleaning-guide/index.html"> Clean sapphire</a> with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth.
