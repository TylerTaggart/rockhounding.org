        <h1>Garnet: The Multifaceted Gemstone</h1>
      
        <section id="overview">
          <h2>Introduction to Garnet</h2>
          <p>Garnet is a group of silicate minerals that have been appreciated for their beauty and utility for thousands of years. Known for its diverse colors and rich history, garnet is a popular gemstone in both jewelry and industrial applications. The name "garnet" comes from the Latin word "granatus," meaning "seed-like," likely referring to the gemstone's resemblance to the red seeds of the pomegranate.</p>
          <p>Garnets are most commonly recognized for their deep red color, but they can be found in almost every color of the rainbow, including green, orange, yellow, and purple. The variation in color is due to the different chemical compositions found within the garnet group, which includes minerals such as almandine, pyrope, spessartine, grossular, and andradite.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="formation">
          <h2>How Garnet Forms</h2>
          <p>Garnets form under a wide range of geological conditions and are found in many types of rocks, including metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks. The formation process involves the crystallization of aluminum and other metals under high pressure and temperature. Garnets are typically found in metamorphic rocks such as schist and gneiss, where they form during the metamorphism of shale and other silicate materials.</p>
          <p>The crystals often develop in well-formed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron">dodecahedrons</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezohedron">trapezohedrons</a>, and their size can range from microscopic grains to large crystals weighing several kilograms. The conditions under which garnets form influence their composition and color, resulting in the wide variety of garnet types found worldwide.</p>

          <h3>Spessartine</h3>
          <img src="../../wiki-images/Spessartine.jpg" alt="Spessartine Garnet" class="crystal-image">
          <p>This type of garnet ranges from orange to reddish-orange and is sometimes called "mandarin garnet" due to its vivid hue.</p>
          
          <h3>Grossular</h3>

        <section id="structure-properties">
          <h2>Garnet's Structure and Properties</h2>
          <p>Garnets belong to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nesosilicate">nesosilicate group</a>, characterized by their isolated silicate tetrahedrons. The general chemical formula for garnet is X₃Y₂(SiO₄)₃, where X and Y represent different metal ions such as iron, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. The specific combination of these ions determines the type of garnet and its color.</p>
          <p>Garnets have a hardness of 6.5 to 7.5 on <a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/mohs-hardness-scale/index.html">the Mohs scale</a>, making them durable enough for most types of jewelry. They exhibit a vitreous luster and can be transparent to opaque. Garnets also have a high refractive index, which gives them their brilliance and fire, especially in the case of gem-quality stones.</p>
          <p>Some garnets, like andradite, display optical phenomena such as <a href="https://www.geologyin.com/2018/03/types-of-iridescent-gemstones-minerals.html">iridescence</a> or a star-like effect known as asterism, which adds to their allure.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section id="uses">
          <h2>Uses of Garnet</h2>
          <p><img src="../../wiki-images/garnetJewelry.jpg" alt="Garnet Jewelry" class="crystal-image">Garnet's primary use is in jewelry, where it is valued for its wide range of colors and brilliant luster. It is often used in rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. Red garnets, particularly almandine and pyrope, are the most common and are frequently seen in both vintage and contemporary jewelry designs.</p>
          <p>Beyond its aesthetic appeal, garnet is also used in industrial applications due to its hardness and abrasive properties. It is commonly used as an abrasive in waterjet cutting, sandblasting, and as a filtration medium in water purification systems. The gemstone's durability and sharp edges make it ideal for these purposes.</p>
          <p>While garnet's primary appeal lies in its aesthetic qualities, its functional properties have made it a valuable resource in both art and industry, demonstrating the versatility of this remarkable gemstone.</p>
