            <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong><a href="https://www.rockhounding.org/blog/crystal-cleaning-guide/index.html"> Clean quartz</a> with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners and harsh chemicals, as these can damage the stone's surface or cause it to crack. Quartz should not be exposed to extreme temperatures or acids.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store quartz separately from harder gemstones to prevent scratches. Keep it in a soft pouch or lined jewelry box to protect it from dust and abrasion.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling:</strong> Quartz is relatively hard and durable, but it can still be prone to chipping and cracking. Handle it with care, especially when wearing or cleaning jewelry. Avoid exposing quartz to direct sunlight for prolonged periods, as this can cause the color to fade.</li>
            <li><strong>Repolishing:</strong> Over time, quartz may lose its luster due to wear and tear. Professional repolishing can restore the stone's shine and enhance its appearance.</li>
        </ul>
