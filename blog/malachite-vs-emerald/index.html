            <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties of Emerald</h2>
            <p>Emerald, scientifically known as Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>, is a gemstone variety of the mineral beryl, distinguished by its rich green color primarily due to trace amounts of chromium and vanadium [<a href="https://www.multicolour.com/emerald/emerald-physical-properties.html">12</a>] [<a href="https://geo.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Geology/Gemology/16%3A_Gemstones/16.04%3A_Beryl/16.4.03%3A_Emerald">16</a>]. This gemstone is renowned for its hardness, scoring 7.5 to 8 on the Mohs scale, which makes it significantly durable but less hard compared to diamonds, rubies, and sapphires [<a href="https://emeralds.com/education/emerald-jewelry/caring-for-emerald-jewelry/">9</a>] [<a href="https://www.multicolour.com/emerald/emerald-physical-properties.html">12</a>] [<a href="https://geologyscience.com/minerals/silicates-minerals/emerald/?amp">14</a>] [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Minerals/Emerald.html">15</a>]. Here are some critical physical and chemical properties of emeralds:</p>
            
            <h3>Crystal Structure and Optical Properties:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Crystal System: Hexagonal.</li>
                <li>Refractive Index: Ranges from 1.566 to 1.602, contributing to its brilliant sparkle.</li>
                <li>Birefringence: Between 0.004 and 0.010, indicative of the crystal's double-refracting nature.</li>
                <li>Dispersion: 0.014, affecting the way light spreads into spectral colors within the gem.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Physical Durability and Care:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific Gravity: Typically between 2.67 and 2.78, which helps in identifying genuine stones [<a href="https://www.multicolour.com/emerald/emerald-physical-properties.html">12</a>] [<a href="https://www.gemstones-guide.com/Physical-Optical-Properties-of-Emeralds.html">13</a>] [<a href="https://geologyscience.com/minerals/silicates-minerals/emerald/?amp">14</a>] [<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Minerals/Emerald.html">15</a>].</li>
