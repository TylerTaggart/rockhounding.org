            <p>While copper is techincally a semi-preciouis metal, we include it here because so many people enjoy
                hunting for copper ore and copper viens. Gold and silver on the other hand are precious metals, and
                are quite the thrill to hunt for and find. There are many methods for searching out each of these

            <h2>Methods of Prospecting</h2>
            <p>There are many different methods for prospecting for precious metals, including panning, sluicing,
                dredging, and more. Each method has its own advantages and challenges, so it's important to choose
                the one that best suits your needs and experience level.</p>

            <h2>Panning</h2>
            <div class="text-and-photo"> <img class="non-gallery" src="./precious-images/goldPan.png">
                <p>Panning is one of the oldest and simplest methods of prospecting for gold. It involves using a
                    pan to
                    separate gold from gravel or sand by swirling the mixture around in water. The heavier gold
                    particles will sink to the bottom of the pan, while lighter material will wash away. Panning can
                    be
                    done in almost any body of water, from rivers to streams to lakes.</p>

            <div class="text-and-photo"><img class="non-gallery" src="./precious-images/goldSluice.png">
                <p>Sluicing is a method of prospecting that uses a long, narrow trough called a sluice box to
                    channel
                    water and separate gold from other materials. As water runs through the sluice box, riffles
                    catch
                    the heavier gold particles and allow lighter material to wash away. Sluicing is typically done
                    in
                    areas with flowing water and can be a very efficient way to recover gold.</p>

            <div class="text-and-photo"> <img class="gallery" src="./precious-images/goldDredge.png">
                <p>Dredging is a method of prospecting that involves using a suction hose to extract gold from river
                    bottoms or stream beds. A dredge is essentially a vacuum cleaner that sucks up material from the
                    river or stream bed and separates the gold using a sluice box or other method. Dredging can be
                    an
                    effective way to recover large quantities of gold, but it can also be expensive and
                    environmentally
                    damaging if not done responsibly.</p>

            <div class="text-and-photo"><img class="gallery" src="./precious-images/metalDetector.png">
                <p>Metal detecting is a method of prospecting that uses a handheld device to detect metal buried
                    underground. This method can be effective for finding gold nuggets or other metal deposits that
                    are
                    hidden beneath the surface. Metal detecting can be done in a variety of locations, including
                    deserts, mountains, and even urban areas. However, it can also be time-consuming and require a
                    lot
                    of patience.</p>

                <p>Finding precious metals in their natural state can be extremely rewarding and fun. However, that is not the only way to find precious metals. Due to the explosion of technology over the last few decades, and the rampant consumer culture, people throw away precious metals literally every day. You can find (and extract) precious metals from electronics, wires, and all sorts of other places if you know how to look.</p>
