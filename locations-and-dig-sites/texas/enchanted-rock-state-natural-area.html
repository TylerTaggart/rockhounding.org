          <h2>Best Time to Visit Enchanted Rock State Natural Area</h2>
          <p>The best time to visit Enchanted Rock for rockhounding is during the <strong>fall</strong> (September to November) and <strong>spring</strong> (March to May), when temperatures are mild, typically ranging from 60°F to 80°F (16°C to 27°C).
