      <h2>Rockhounding At The Oceanview Mine</h2>
      <div class="content-wrapper">

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>Visit the Oceanview Mine for a chance to find your own gems—tourmalines, kunzites, morganites, and more! Your visit offers a unique view of the only actively working underground mine in the world-famous Pala Gem mining district. Come visit us for this one-of-a-kind experience—like nothing else in the world.</p>
            <p>A visit to the Oceanview Mine allows you to screen the dump piles of material we take out of our mine and find the gems we've missed—and we miss a lot! You get to keep everything you find at no extra charge; the standard dig fee allows you to keep all you find and take home one 5-gallon bucket of rocks that you have screened and washed.</p>
            <p>Guests also get a jeep tour of Chief Mountain where you can see all of the currently active mines and prospects, as well as views of the famous Pala Chief, Tourmaline Queen, and other historic mines. We've taken care of everything you need. We provide you with screens, water, buckets, and shovels—and most importantly, a big pile of gem-rich dirt and gravel taken from our mines!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <div class="text-block">
            <p>After a brief training session, you have four hours to work the pile, looking for your gems. The standard dig fee allows you to keep all you find. You can also take home one 5-gallon bucket of rocks that you have screened and washed if you want to more carefully sort through them at home.</p>
            <p>Reservations are required. Please take the time to read this page to learn all about how our fee dig works. This will answer almost all of your questions and help ensure that your trip is a great success.</p>
            <p>Arriving at the dig—please be prompt! The dig starts very promptly. This gives you time to check in, pay the fee, turn in your paperwork, and then drive the remaining half mile to the top of Chief Mountain. After you park your car, put your lunch in the pavilion, so it won't overheat in your car, and ask the dig host what table you will be assigned to.</p>

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>The Oceanview Mine is located in California's Pala mining district. This area is accessible by car, and more information on how to ge there will be provided after you book your trip.</p>
      <p>The mine is privately owned, and so the only way to dig is to book through <a href="https://www.oceanviewmine.com/" target="_blank">https://www.oceanviewmine.com/</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>How to get there:</strong><br>
        The mine is located just east of the town of Pala, California, in San Diego County. A precise location will be given once you book your trip. This is an active mine, and so the public can only show up on specific days as detaild on their site. Upon making the reservation a precise map will be sent to you with other important information.<br><br>
      <strong>Where to collect:</strong><br>
      Upon ariving, you will experience an orrientation that explains how the dig site works. It is recommended you bring your own gloves, food, and water. Other tools needed will be provided at the dig site. A "dig pile" will be created for each person to scoop dirt that is likely to contian gemstones into a bucket. Each person will then take their bucket to the sifting station to search for gemstones.</p>

      <h1>Recommended Gear and Tips</h1>
      <p>When visiting the Oceanview Mine, it's important to come prepared. Here are some recommendations for your trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan to stay for at least a full day to fully explore the area and increase your chances of finding valuable gems.</li>
        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the gems you find.</li>
        <li>Tools recommended: a shovel, pick, safety glasses and hammer (in case you want to break your gems on the spot). Whole gems can be taken to your local rock shop to be cut in half.</li>
        <li>More importantly, be patient and have fun collecting!</li>

      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For Oceanview Mine</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/oceanviewMine3.png" alt="Finding Gems Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Gems can often be found by carefully breaking open larger rocks. Look for areas where the rocks have weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed gems.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rock to reveal potential gems. The gems can range in size and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock.</p>
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose gems that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the dig site. Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the gems from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the gems and other minerals like quartz and agate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Methods for opening gems include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Breaking and smashing: You can place a gem in a cloth sack or similar and smash on a hard surface. This may break the gem into many small pieces.</li>
            <li>Hammer and chisel or center punch: This will open your gem with a rough or uneven edge.</li>
            <li>Sawing: You can cut a gem with a rock or similar saw. Most tools with a carbide tipped blade will cut a gem. This works well if you also want to polish it.</li>
            <li>Pipe cutter: You can use a tool called a soil pipe cutter which uses chain with blades to cut the gem as if it were a pipe. Tools like this can sometimes be rented from home improvement stores.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Please be careful while digging, the soft material you are digging in can collapse at any time. Tunneling is unsafe and not permitted.</strong></p>
