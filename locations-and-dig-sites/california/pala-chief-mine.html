      <h2>Rockhounding At The Pala Chief Mine</h2>
      <div class="content-wrapper">

        <div class="text-block">
            <p>Welcome to the Pala Chief Mine! Located in beautiful Pala, California, the Pala Chief is one of the oldest gem mines in San Diego County and one of the only historic mines still actively worked in the hunt for American gemstones. The deposits here were discovered in May 1903, and the mine produced large amounts of tourmaline, most of which was shipped to China for the carving trade. It was also the primary discovery site of the purple gem variety of spodumene known as kunzite, and the first true source of gem-quality kunzite.</p>
            <p>The Pala Chief Mine digs are a unique opportunity to explore some of the old mine dumps from the Pala Chief Mine and the various nearby prospects. There are multiple dumps to go through, some recent and some dating back to the earliest days of mining on the mountain. This dig, held only twice a month from October to June, is best described as a freestyle bring-your-own-tools and dig-your-own-way experience. Collecting ranges from walking around to attacking the pegmatites themselves with heavy tools.</p>
            <p>Reservations are required 48 hours in advance, and the cost is $75 per person. The whole side of Chief Mountain is the collecting area with 100-year-old dumps that contain tourmaline, kunzite, morganite, aquamarine, quartz, and garnets, both loose and on matrix. There is a lot of uphill walking, so participants should be at least 12 years of age.</p>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <div class="text-block">
            <p>Unlike the Oceanview Mine fee dig, no equipment is provided for the Chief Dig. You must bring your own gear. Suggested tools include screens, two five-gallon buckets, gloves, a rock hammer and chisels, a small hand-held garden rake, and a small shovel. Some water is available at key places on the hill, but it is recommended to bring bottled water for hydration.</p>
            <p>The Pala Chief Mine digs are held on some Sundays only, from 7:30 AM (sharp) until four hours after the start. Wear clothing you don't mind getting dirty and bring your own lunch, drinks, hats, and sunscreen. If this doesn’t sound right for you, please sign up for the Oceanview Mine dig, which is suitable for all ages and provides tools year-round, three days a week.</p>
            <p>The various mines and prospects on the west side of the mountain have produced a wide variety of minerals. You can find tourmalines, aquamarines, morganites, triphane, kunzite, and more. Quartz crystals are regularly found, ranging from smoky to citrine to optical-grade clear crystals. The tourmalines come in a variety of colors, from black schorls to red and blue elbaites and nearly everything in between. Nice specimens of feldspar and cleavelandite are also regularly found.</p>

      <h2>Location of The Pala Chief Mine in California</h2>
      <p>The Pala Chief Mine is located in California's Pala mining district. This area is accessible by car, and more information on how to get there will be provided after you book your trip.</p>
      <p>The mine is privately owned, and so the only way to dig is to book through <a href="https://www.oceanviewmine.com/pala-chief-mine/" target="_blank">https://www.oceanviewmine.com/pala-chief-mine/</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>How to get there:</strong><br>
        The mine is located just east of the town of Pala, California, in San Diego County. A precise location will be given once you book your trip. This is an active mine, and so the public can only show up on specific days as detailed on their site. Upon making the reservation, a precise map will be sent to you with other important information.<br><br>
      <strong>Where to collect:</strong><br>
      Upon arrival, you will experience an orientation that explains how the dig site works. It is recommended you bring your own gloves, food, and water. Other tools needed will be provided at the dig site. A "dig pile" will be created for each person to scoop dirt that is likely to contain gemstones into a bucket. Each person will then take their bucket to the sifting station to search for gemstones.</p>

      <h1>Recommended Gear and Tips for The Pala Chief Mine</h1>
      <p>When visiting the Pala Chief Mine, it's important to come prepared. Here are some recommendations for your trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan to stay for at least a full day to fully explore the area and increase your chances of finding valuable gems.</li>
        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the gems you find.</li>
        <li>Tools recommended: a shovel, pick, safety glasses, and hammer (in case you want to break your gems on the spot). Whole gems can be taken to your local rock shop to be cut in half.</li>
        <li>More importantly, be patient and have fun collecting!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For The Pala Chief Mine</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/palaChiefMine3.png" alt="Finding Gems Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Gems can often be found by carefully breaking open larger rocks. Look for areas where the rocks have weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed gems.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rock to reveal potential gems. The gems can range in size and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock.</p>
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose gems that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the dig site. Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the gems from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the gems and other minerals like quartz and agate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Methods for opening gems include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Breaking and smashing: You can place a gem in a cloth sack or similar and smash it on a hard surface. This may break the gem into many small pieces.</li>
            <li>Hammer and chisel or center punch: This will open your gem with a rough or uneven edge.</li>
            <li>Sawing: You can cut a gem with a rock or similar saw. Most tools with a carbide-tipped blade will cut a gem. This works well if you also want to polish it.</li>
            <li>Pipe cutter: You can use a tool called a soil pipe cutter which uses a chain with blades to cut the gem as if it were a pipe. Tools like this can sometimes be rented from home improvement stores.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Please be careful while digging, the soft material you are digging in can collapse at any time. Tunneling is unsafe and not permitted.</strong></p>
