            <p>The experience at Oceanview Mine is enhanced by the provision of all necessary tools, including screens, water, buckets, and shovels. Visitors can keep all the gems they find and take home one 5-gallon bucket of rocks that they have screened and washed.

Konocti, a dormant volcano, was once part of a larger volcanic chain that included Mount St. Helena to the south. The eruptions that occurred over two million years ago left behind thick deposits of basalt, within which the Lake County Diamonds were formed.</p>

      <h2>Recommended Gear and Tips for Rockhounding in California</h2>
      <p>When visiting rockhounding sites in California, it's important to come prepared. Here are some recommendations for your trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan to stay for at least a full day to fully explore the area and increase your chances of finding valuable gems.</li>
        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the gems you find.</li>
        <li>Tools recommended: a shovel, pick, safety glasses, and hammer (in case you want to break your gems on the spot). Whole gems can be taken to your local rock shop to be cut in half.</li>
        <li>More importantly, be patient and have fun collecting!</li>
