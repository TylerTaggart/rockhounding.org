            <p>The Benitoite Mining Company in California offers a unique opportunity to discover Benitoite, the state gem of California. This premier gem hunting destination provides an exciting adventure for rockhounds to find Benitoite, Neptunite, Joaquinite, and Natrolite.</p>
            <p>Visitors can enjoy digging through ore from the mine that is dumped into a screening field, making it easy and accessible. No spelunking required! All necessary digging tools are provided, so there is no need to bring your own. You can keep all you find, with up to one quart-sized bag of finds per person included in the admission fee.</p>
            <p>The standard dig fee allows you to keep all you find and take home one quart-sized bag of rocks that you have screened and washed. The site is open by reservation on Saturdays and Sundays from 9 AM to 3 PM, and on certain holidays.</p>
          </div>

            <p>Orientation is provided to help you get started, and staff are available throughout the day to assist and answer questions. It is recommended to arrive as early as possible to maximize your digging time and increase your chances of finding valuable stones.</p>
            <p>The four main minerals specific to this site are Benitoite, Neptunite, Joaquinite, and Natrolite. Most people find something, but about 1 in 20 walk away with a stone of significant value. The harder you work, the better your chances of finding something good.</p>
            <p>There is no limit on the amount of material you can go through, but there is a limit on how much you can take homeâ€”up to one quart-sized bag per person. If you find something too large to fit in your bag, it can be priced for you. Wear clothing you don't mind getting dirty, and bring your lunches, drinks, hats, and sunscreen.</p>

      <h1>Recommended Gear and Tips for The Benitoite Mining Company</h1>
      <p>When visiting the Benitoite Mining Company, it's important to come prepared. Here are some recommendations for your trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan to stay for at least a full day to fully explore the area and increase your chances of finding valuable gems.</li>
        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the gems you find.</li>

      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For The Benitoite Mining Company</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/benitoiteMiningCompany3.png" alt="Finding Gems Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Gems can often be found by carefully breaking open larger rocks. Look for areas where the rocks have weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed gems.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rock to reveal potential gems. The gems can range in size and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock.</p>
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose gems that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the dig site. Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the gems from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the gems and other minerals like quartz and agate.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Methods for opening gems include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Breaking and smashing: You can place a gem in a cloth sack or similar and smash it on a hard surface. This may break the gem into many small pieces.</li>
            <li>Hammer and chisel or center punch: This will open your gem with a rough or uneven edge.</li>
            <li>Sawing: You can cut a gem with a rock or similar saw. Most tools with a carbide-tipped blade will cut a gem. This works well if you also want to polish it.</li>
            <li>Pipe cutter: You can use a tool called a soil pipe cutter which uses a chain with blades to cut the gem as if it were a pipe. Tools like this can sometimes be rented from home improvement stores.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Please be careful while digging, the soft material you are digging in can collapse at any time. Tunneling is unsafe and not permitted.</strong></p>
