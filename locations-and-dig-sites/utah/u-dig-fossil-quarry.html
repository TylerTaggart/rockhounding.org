        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Trilobites can often be found by carefully breaking open larger rocks. Look for areas where the rocks have weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed fossils.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rock to reveal potential fossils. The fossils can range in size and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock.</p>

      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose fossils that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the dig site.</p>
          <p>Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the fossils from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the fossils and other minerals like quartz and agate.</p>
