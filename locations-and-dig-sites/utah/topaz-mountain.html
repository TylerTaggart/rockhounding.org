      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>Topaz Mountain is located in the Thomas Range of Utah. The exact coordinates are 39.7143° N, 113.1042° W. This area is accessible by car, with several marked trails leading to prime rockhounding spots.</p>
      <p>The Topaz Dome Quarry is split into two sections: a public dig site and a private dig site. The private dig site is available for paid mountain dynamite blasts, offering a more intensive and productive rockhounding experience. The public site is available for free, but you will need to get creative to find your own ways to break off chunks of rock in order to find the topaz crystals hiding in vugs.</p>

      <h1>Recommended Gear and Tips</h1>

        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the minerals you find.</li>

      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For Topaz Mountain</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/topazMountain4.png" alt="Finding Topaz Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Topaz can often be found in the rhyolite rock formations that are abundant in the Topaz Mountain area. Look for areas where the rock has weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed crystals.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rhyolite to reveal potential topaz crystals. The crystals can range in color from clear to amber and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock as pictured here.</p>
          <p>If you do not see any exposed vugs, you can often break larger chunks of rhyolite in half by striking it with a hammer or hammer & chisel. When the rock splits, this will often expose new vugs and topaz crystals that were hidden inside.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose topaz crystals that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the base of the mountain.</p>
          <p>Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the crystals from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the topaz and other minerals like red beryl and garnet.</p>
          <p>If you want to preserve the sherry topaz color, be sure to get your topaz crystals out of sunlight as soon as possible, as exposure to UV rays will turn the crystals clear.</p>
