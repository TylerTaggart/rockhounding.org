      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For Wah Wah Mountains</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/wahWahMountains2.png" alt="Finding Red Beryl Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Red beryl can often be found in the rhyolite rock formations that are abundant in the Wah Wah Mountains. Look for areas where the rock has weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed crystals.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rhyolite to reveal potential red beryl crystals. The crystals can range in color from light pink to deep red and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock as pictured here.</p>

      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose red beryl crystals that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the base of the mountains.</p>
          <p>Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the crystals from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the red beryl and other minerals like garnet and topaz.</p>
