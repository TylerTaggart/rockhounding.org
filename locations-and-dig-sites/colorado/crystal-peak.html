          <div class="text-block">
              <ul>
                  <li>Surface Searching: Many gems can be found on the surface, especially after rain, which washes away loose soil and reveals hidden treasures.</li>
                  <li>Hillside Slopes: Focus your search on hillside slopes and areas where erosion is evident, as gems tend to accumulate in these locations.</li>
                  <li>Look for Distinctive Colors: Gems like amazonite and smoky quartz have distinctive colors that stand out from the surrounding rocks.</li>
                  <li>Creek Beds: Pay attention to creek beds where water flow exposes gems embedded in the gravel and sand.</li>
                  <li>Gentle Extraction: Use a rock hammer to carefully chip away at larger rocks to uncover gems hidden within. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying debris.</li>
                  <li>Thorough Exploration: Dedicate ample time to explore various areas, including exposed rock faces, scree slopes, and streambeds.</li>
              </ul>
