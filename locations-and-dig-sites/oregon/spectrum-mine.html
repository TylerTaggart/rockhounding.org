      <h1>Recommended Gear and Tips for The Spectrum Mine</h1>
      <p>When visiting the Spectrum Mine, it's important to come prepared. Here are some recommendations for your trip:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan to stay for at least a full day to fully explore the area and increase your chances of finding valuable sunstones.</li>
        <li>Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection, as the area can get quite hot and there are limited facilities nearby.</li>
        <li>Wear sturdy shoes and protective gloves to prevent injuries from sharp rocks and tools.</li>
        <li>Carry tools such as rock hammers, chisels, and safety glasses to safely extract and handle the sunstones you find.</li>
        <li>Tools recommended: a shovel, pick, safety glasses, and hammer (in case you want to break your sunstones on the spot). Whole sunstones can be taken to your local rock shop to be cut in half.</li>
        <li>More importantly, be patient and have fun collecting!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Rockhounding Tips For The Spectrum Mine</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/spectrumMine3.png" alt="Finding Sunstones Tips" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Sunstones can often be found by carefully breaking open larger rocks. Look for areas where the rocks have weathered and eroded, as this can make it easier to find exposed sunstones.</p>
          <p>Using a rock hammer, carefully chip away at the rock to reveal potential sunstones. The sunstones can range in size and are typically found in small cavities or vugs within the rock.</p>
          <p>Another effective method is to search the ground surface for loose sunstones that have been naturally weathered out of the rock. These can often be found in the sandy areas surrounding the dig site. Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the sunstones from the sand and dirt. This can make it easier to spot the sunstones and other minerals.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>Methods for opening sunstones include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Breaking and smashing: You can place a sunstone in a cloth sack or similar and smash it on a hard surface. This may break the sunstone into many small pieces.</li>
            <li>Hammer and chisel or center punch: This will open your sunstone with a rough or uneven edge.</li>
            <li>Sawing: You can cut a sunstone with a rock or similar saw. Most tools with a carbide-tipped blade will cut a sunstone. This works well if you also want to polish it.</li>
            <li>Pipe cutter: You can use a tool called a soil pipe cutter which uses a chain with blades to cut the sunstone as if it were a pipe. Tools like this can sometimes be rented from home improvement stores.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Please be careful while digging, the soft material you are digging in can collapse at any time. Tunneling is unsafe and not permitted.</strong></p>
