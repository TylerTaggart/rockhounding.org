            <li>Search the Old Tailings: Old mining tailings can still contain gold. Look for areas where miners have previously worked.</li>
            <li>Metal Detecting: Use a metal detector to locate larger nuggets and buried treasures.</li>
            <li>Look for Quartz Veins: Gold is often found in quartz veins, so keep an eye out for white quartz in the rock formations.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
        <p><p>The piles of rock debris (tailings) left behind from mining operations can be a good place to start looking. These tailings may contain leftover minerals that were not extracted during the mining process.</p>
        <p>Before heading out, research any regulations or restrictions on rockhounding in the area. You might need permits or permissions from relevant authorities or landowners.
