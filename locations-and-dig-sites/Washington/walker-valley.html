    <h2>Rockhounding Tips for Walker Valley</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/rockhoundingInWalkerValley.jpg" alt="Rockhounding in Walker Valley" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <ul>
            <li>Surface Searching: Many geodes can be found on the surface, especially after rain, which washes away loose soil and reveals hidden gems.</li>
            <li>Hillside Slopes: Concentrate your search on hillside slopes and areas where erosion is evident, as geodes tend to accumulate in these locations.</li>
            <li>Look for Round Shapes: Geodes often have a round or oval shape, so keep an eye out for these distinctive forms.</li>
            <li>Creek Beds: Focus on the creek beds where water flow exposes geodes embedded in the gravel and sand.</li>
            <li>Gentle Extraction: Use a rock hammer to carefully chip away at larger rocks to uncover geodes hidden within. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying debris.</li>
        </ul>
