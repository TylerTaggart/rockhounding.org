    <h2>Rockhounding Tips for Stonewall Creek</h2>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <img src="../dig-site-images/Jasper stone.jpg" alt="Jasper Stone" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
          <ul>
            <li>Surface Searching: Many petrified wood pieces and agates can be found on the surface, especially after rain, which washes away loose soil and reveals hidden gems.</li>
            <li>Creek Beds: Focus on the creek beds where water flow exposes minerals embedded in the gravel and sand.</li>
            <li>Look for Patterns: Petrified wood and agates often have distinctive colors and patterns, so keep an eye out for these characteristics.</li>
            <li>Gentle Extraction: Use a rock hammer to carefully chip away at larger rocks to uncover minerals hidden within. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying debris.</li>
            <li>Erosion Areas: Concentrate your search on areas where erosion is evident, as minerals tend to accumulate in these locations.</li>
            <li>Check Gravel Bars: Explore gravel bars and areas where the creek has deposited sediment, as these are prime locations for finding treasures.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>The creek bed itself is a prime spot to search for agates and other minerals. Look for exposed gravel bars, areas where water has eroded the banks, and around larger rocks. Explore the hills and slopes around the creek. Agates and other minerals can often be found weathering out of the soil or exposed in rocky outcrops.</p>
          <p>The best time to visit is during the drier months (summer and fall) when the water levels are lower, and more of the creek bed is exposed. Before you head out, research the area and learn about the geology and specific types of minerals found in the Stonewall Creek area. This will help you identify potential finds.</p>
