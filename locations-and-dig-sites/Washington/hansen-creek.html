        <img src="../dig-site-images/hansenCreekQuartz.jpg" alt="Finding Quartz in Hansen Creek" class="left-image">
        <div class="text-block">
        <p><strong>Surface Searching:</strong> Many crystals can be found on the surface, especially after rain, which washes away loose soil and reveals hidden gems.</p>
        <p><strong>Creek Beds:</strong> Focus on the creek beds where water flow exposes crystals embedded in the gravel and sand.</p>
        <p><strong>Gentle Extraction:</strong> Use a rock hammer to carefully chip away at larger rocks to uncover crystals hidden within. Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying debris.</p>
        <p><strong>Sifting:</strong> Bring a sifter or a small hand-held screen to help separate the crystals from the sand and dirt, making it easier to spot the quartz and other minerals.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="tips-section">
        <div class="text-block">
          <p>The best time to visit is spring or fall when temperatures are milder and snow is less likely. Park at the designated parking area and hike up the well-marked trail to the digging site. Respect any closed-off areas.</p>
          <p>While digging, focus on areas where the ground has been disturbed or where others have had success. Dig carefully and avoid undermining other diggers. Use your classifier screen to separate dirt from any potential finds. Look for the telltale sparkle of quartz crystals.</p>
          <p>Be aware of your surroundings, watch for loose rocks, and take breaks to avoid overexertion.</p>
